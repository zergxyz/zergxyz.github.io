  This is my blog, where I have written over 275 articles on a variety of
  topics, most of which are about one of two major themes. The first is computer
  science, which is my area of specialty as a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. The
  second can be broadly categorized as "deafness," which relates to my
  experience and knowledge of being deaf.
