The news is out that [Sir Tim Berners-Lee has won the 2016 Turing Award][1], the
highest honor in computer science. (Turing Award winners are usually announced a
few months *after* the actual year of the award.) He is best known for inventing
the World Wide Web, as clearly highlighted by the ACM's citation:

> For inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental
> protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale.

(You can also find more information about some of his work [on his personal
website][3], where he has some helpful FAQs.)

My first reaction to reading the news was: *he didn't already have a Turing
Award*?!? I actually thought he had been a co-winner with Vinton Cerf and Robert
Kahn, but nope. At least he's won it now, so [we won't be asking Quora posts
like this one anymore][2].

I'm rather surprised that this announcement wasn't covered by many mainstream
newspapers. I tried searching for something in the New York Times, but nothing
showed up. This is rather a shame, because if we think of *inventing the World
Wide Web* as the "bar" for the Turing Award, then that's a pretty high bar.

My prediction for the winner was actually Geoffrey Hinton, but I can't argue
with Sir Tim Berners-Lee. (Thus, Hinton is going to be my prediction for the
2017 award.) Just like Terrence Tao for the Fields Medalist, Steven Weinberg for
the Nobel Prize in Physics, Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, and so on,
they're so utterly qualified that I can't think of a reason to oppose them.
