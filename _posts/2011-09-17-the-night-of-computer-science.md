Last Thursday night, I decided to finally start on my 3 computer science programs that I thought were due on Sunday night (they were actually due 2 days later &#8230; a big relief!). I figured that this wouldn&#8217;t take that long. I had to write a program that would spit out certain prime numbers to the user. Of course, there were more specifications, but that&#8217;s the general idea. Maybe it&#8217;s a bit hackneyed, but I decided to make a record of what happened in a diary format. It may be used by me as a way to laugh at myself.

Some background: I&#8217;m programming in the C language, and I&#8217;m using emacs to assist in compiling and input/output.

11:09 PM: I arrive in the computer science lab. It&#8217;s in an obscure room on the top floor of the science center (third floor). At least it&#8217;s (a) close to my dorm room and (b) has a nice view on both sides of the room of the science library below. I see that four other guys are there in the lab. They&#8217;re probably all in some 300 or 400-level class.

11:37 PM: After nearly a half hour of frustration with emacs, I finally figure out how to start typing my C program! Why couldn&#8217;t this be on a crystal-clear template? My &#8220;Intro to emacs&#8221; sheet lists commands, but it doesn&#8217;t have suggestions.

12:00 AM: It&#8217;s midnight, and one of the guys working near me keeps throwing a ball up in the air and cursing at his computer. I resume typing my program, which is going well so far.

12:15 AM: The guy who kept cursing and banging on his desk gives up. He tells his classmates that he&#8217;s had enough for the night. I find out that he&#8217;s in an advanced compilers class. He leaves, and one of his classmates follows suit.

12:32 AM: My code should now work for numbers (as input) that are less than or equal to two. Mission accomp &#8230; oh wait, I have to take in account input that&#8217;s greater than two?

1:00 AM: Still toiling in the lab. One of the guys who had left a half hour ago brings some pizza he got and offers it to me. It&#8217;s sausage and bacon-flavored. No thanks. I prefer cheese and buffalo chicken pizza.

1:26 AM: The second method I have is malfunctioning. Why?!?!? I decide to take a break and re-fill my water bottle.

1:39 AM: I think it works! I test out the program and it works for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and &#8230;8?!? Crap, it works for all numbers OTHER than 8? And I was just about to leave.

1:48 AM: I &#8220;revised&#8221; my code. Now it doesn&#8217;t work for the number 3! (That&#8217;s not a factorial, by the way.)

1:59 AM: It doesn&#8217;t work with number 10, but it works with all other numbers. What is going on with 3, 8, and 10 tonight?

2:04 AM: Well, that&#8217;s it. I think I&#8217;m done for now. The program should now work for any number that&#8217;s inputted by the user. It&#8217;s not completely done, since I&#8217;ve got to take into account multiple integers as input, but I&#8217;ve done as much as I think I can manage. I need to sleep. I walk out of the building and in about 100 steps I get back to my room. Good night. I realize that if I were using Java, I would have finished before midnight. But Java sucks.

It&#8217;s a bit late now, but tomorrow, I have to finish up these programs.
