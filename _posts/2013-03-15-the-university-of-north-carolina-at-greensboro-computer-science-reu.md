This summer, I am going to participate in the [University of North Carolina at Greensboro algorithmic combinatorics on words REU][1]. The research there pertains to algorithms and theory of computation, so I&#8217;m diverging from machine learning (at least for a short while). This will be my second REU experience, and I hope to make the most of my eight weeks there. Now, the task is to contact their administrators &#8212; starting today &#8212; so that I can set up my accommodation services (sign language interpreters). I don&#8217;t know of a way to do this other than to just keep emailing them about suggestions, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be doing.

I haven&#8217;t done a whole lot of writing this past month, and it&#8217;s going to be even more difficult with the general GREs coming up in less than a week. But I&#8217;ll probably do more writing after that.
