I have long wondered how much effort students should expend to achieving high grades. Dr. Philip Guo
has a [nice article][1] about this that I found to be accurate and straightforward. Those applying
to medical school and competitive law or graduate school positions need high grades. On the other
end of the scale, students inheriting a family fortune need not worry about graduating with honors.
As expected, the amount of effort and dedication a student spends on getting good grades is
dependent on a variety of circumstances. Students should also understand that putting too much focus
on doing well academically might mean they neglect other important aspects of preparing for the
workforce.

One other thing I would like to add on is that the importance of grades also matters when
considering a person&#8217;s skills in intermingling, networking, and socializing. Intuitively, the
reasoning seems obvious: people who are the best networkers and orators can reach out to a broader
audience and can translate those skills into benefits while on the job. If a student was not among
the top half of his class in college, but absolutely dominated the work he did in a summer
internship by taking advantage of his extroverted personality and social understanding, then he will
be the one getting a full-time job offer after college.

This does not bode well for deaf students. Many people in the workforce will, unfortunately, have a
natural tendency to worry about a potential deaf employee. This may be worse in jobs that require
tremendous communication among workers. And very often, deaf people will have a harder time making
up for that difference with social ability.

That is why I argue that deaf students should spend *lots of effort* towards their grades.

The claim that high grades matter can be supported by arguments that simultaneously show the
benefits of attending a prestigious undergraduate institution, which [Dr. Guo has also written about
on his website][2]. The biggest one is that they help recent college graduates *get started*.
Here&#8217;s what Dr. Guo says:

> Carrying a name-brand diploma gives you the largest boost in credibility right when you graduate,
> the proverbial &#8220;helping to get your foot into the door.&#8221; [&#8230;] As you progress in
> your career and move onto successive jobs, then carrying a name-brand college diploma matters
> less: Intermediate and senior job candidates are evaluated mainly based on their prior work
> experience, so if you&#8217;ve done a great job and received positive recommendations, then that
> could more than make up for your lack of a name-brand diploma. 

You can say similar things about GPA. It matters more to a 25-year-old candidate for his first
software engineering job, but it matters less when interviewing for upper-level management
positions. As a current example &#8212; literally, since the linked article was posted up seven
hours before this blog entry &#8212; a math professor at my college was [just named Southwestern
University&#8217;s 15th president][3]. Do you think Southwestern&#8217;s evaluation committee placed
a heavy emphasis on his GPA? Not a chance, even though he *did *graduate summa cum laude from
Connecticut College. (But wait &#8230; that might have gotten him in graduate school in the first
place!) The selection committee probably highlighted his experience as a renowned innovator of
mathematical education, as evident by his well-earned [Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great
Teaching][4].

Likewise, a high GPA can help make up for an employer&#8217;s initial negative impression of a deaf
job applicant. (Notice that I&#8217;m not implying that people do this. I can only speak for my own
experience and those of other deaf people I know. And this doesn&#8217;t imply that all employers do
this, nor does this vitiate their recruitment process.)

Once people can successfully get started in a job, it&#8217;s up to them to live up to expectations.
