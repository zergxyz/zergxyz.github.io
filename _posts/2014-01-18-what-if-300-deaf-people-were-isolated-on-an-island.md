John Lee Clark, a deaf writer and an active participant in the [Deaf Academics][2] mailing list, has
a blog [on his website][3]. While Mr. Clark doesn&#8217;t appear to update it frequently, his blog
entries are well-written. I particularly found his [Cochlear Implants: A Thought Experiment][4] blog
post interesting.

Here is his &#8220;thought experiment:&#8221;

> Let’s suppose three hundred deaf people, all wearing cochlear implants, are gathered and moved to
> an island. None of them knows ASL and all of them have excellent speech. There are no hearing
> people there. What will happen?

Mr. Clark&#8217;s main argument is that because there are no hearing people to provide feedback on
the deaf population&#8217;s speech skills, the 300 people will experience erosion in their ability
to talk. In response to that, they will develop a *sign language*.

There are some obvious logistical issues with this experiment. This would never happen in the first
place, and even if it did, it is unclear how quickly speech erosion would occur, if it did at all.

As one reads more into Mr. Clark&#8217;s entry, it becomes apparent that he views cochlear implants
with disdain:

> Another thing that it reveals is that the cochlear implant is not FOR deaf people. If it is for
> deaf people, they would be able to, or even want to, use the implants on their own and for their
> own reasons. But the cochlear implant is for, and promotes the interests of, hearing people. It
> was invented by a hearing man and the risky experiments and sometimes fatal operations were
> legalized by hearing people. The demand for it is driven by hearing parents. It financially
> benefits hearing teachers, hearing doctors, hearing speech therapists, and hearing businesses in
> the industry. It is only at the bottom of the industry that we find the token deaf person.

It is known that cochlear implants are a controversial topic in the Deaf community, which is
well-summarized by the [Wikipedia entry on cochlear implants][5]. There was even an entire
documentary about this issue: [Sound of Fury][6]. Mr. Clark also brings up some of the common
arguments against cochlear implants in the rest of his blog post.

I think I should write more about cochlear implants in my blog. This entry is apparently the first
that uses the &#8220;cochlear implant&#8221; tag. Stay tuned for future posts&#8230;.
