President Trump, you should have clearly and unequivocally denounced racism and
white supremacy immediately, *without* trying to pin the blame on "both sides"
or whatever other un-related group comes to mind. Your delayed statement does
not redeem yourself. 

The failure to call out and condemn white supremacy is perhaps *the epitome* of
political correctness. We tragically saw one person, Heather Heyer, murdered
from the events in Charlottesville. In this case, political correctness really
is deadly.

The Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other white nationalist groups do not belong in
our society. We need to always condemn them and aim to eradicate their presence
so that America can become a better place.

America has come a long way since the days of George Washington, Abraham
Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr., but we still have lots of progress to go
before we can truly claim that America provides an equal playing field for its
citizens.
