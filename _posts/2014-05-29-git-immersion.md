One critical skill I acquired this past year was how to use [git][1]. It&#8217;s a distributed
version control system that is often used by programmers and software companies to manage their
code. The reason why git and other version/revision control systems are so useful is that they allow
multiple people to easily work together on a project by means of a shared code repository. Rather
than have one person work on a small part of a project and email any updates to everyone else, he or
she can instead &#8220;push&#8221; their modifications to the repository, and other collaborators
can &#8220;pull&#8221; the updated code so that they are working with the latest version. (I use
&#8220;push&#8221; and &#8220;pull&#8221; since these are git-related terms, but other systems have
different terminologies for adding and getting repository code.)

If the current code has serious issues, it is possible to roll back to a previous version, which is
just like having a bunch of backup files. This is one of the main benefits of using version control
systems, even for a project managed by just one person. For instance, I used git for my
undergraduate thesis and the related code, so whenever I wanted to work on it, I would just pull
from the current repository, make my changes, and then push at the end. Git turned out to be a
lifesaver when, two weeks before I had to send my thesis to the rest of the department, I
accidentally deleted a chapter. The solution? Pull the latest version of that chapter from the
repository.

Git is very common among computer science students, and possibly even more popular among computer
science Ph.D. students, so it&#8217;s a good skill to have in one&#8217;s toolkit. I learned git
largely by trial and error and having other people tell me what to do, but one resource I found that
might be useful to beginners is [Git Immersion][2]. This is a tutorial that walks you through the
basic commands of git. It was mostly review for me, but I did learn a few things, such as ```git
mv``` which will save me time when moving files in my repositories. In the past, I would move files,
then delete the original files from git, then add the new ones (in the different location), then
commit everything, but git mv does all that at once. My one qualm is that I wish they incorporated
[GitHub][3] in the tutorial, but it&#8217;s technically not part of git, so I can see the reason for
excluding it.

Say, I wonder how non-computer scientists write their theses, or more accurately, those who
don&#8217;t employ version control systems. I would hate having to save countless backups for a
variety of files. In addition, another key benefit of git is that each time you make a change, you
can record the high-level idea of this modification, and it will appear in the log for future
reference. This makes it easy to go back and search for an old version of a file.
