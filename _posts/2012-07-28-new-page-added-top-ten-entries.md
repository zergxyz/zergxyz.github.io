**UPDATE** May 13, 2015: With the move of this blog to Jekyll, some of these points might not be
relevant anymore.

With the way the blog has been [growing recently][1], I&#8217;ve decided to add a new page that
contains my ten favorite entries here with rationales, called &#8220;Top Ten Entries.&#8221; You can
find it at the very top of the blog, next to the currently-existing &#8220;About&#8221; page. In a
way, my new page serves as self-motivation, since whenever I&#8217;m in the process of writing a
yet-to-be-published entry, I&#8217;ll be wondering how I can tweak it so it can crack my top ten
list.

Furthermore, the page can be used by readers who want to see a sampling of my work or who do not
have the time to read all entries. I also suggest that people visiting this blog for the first time
should take a look at that page. In the future, I may make a separate page, &#8220;Start
Here,&#8221; just for that purpose, but I think the page I just set up now will be well-suited as a
starting point. Any constructive feedback on the structure of &#8220;Seita&#8217;s Place,&#8221; of
course, is more than welcome.
