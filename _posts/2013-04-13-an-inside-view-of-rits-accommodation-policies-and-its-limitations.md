During my senior year of high school, I was debating between two choices for college: Rochester
Institute of Technology (RIT) and Williams. This comparison is unusual in a variety of ways and
reflects my unique background and approach to the college admissions game. On the one hand, it
doesn&#8217;t seem like most people were making this comparison. As someone who has talked to many
other Williams students, most of the other schools they considered were among the elite liberal arts
colleges (LACs) such as Amherst and Swarthmore, or they were renowned research institutions such as
MIT and Cornell. From what I can tell, I might have been the only student in my Williams College
graduating class to have seriously considered RIT. A few years ago, I discussed my situation with
another Williams student, who promptly told me: &#8220;an obvious decision, right?&#8221;
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple. The catch is that while Williams can claim to have
benefits such as a significantly larger endowment and better college rankings, one of RIT&#8217;s
advertised advantages is its accommodation policies that have been specifically catered to its large
deaf and hard of hearing student population. Here are some of the interesting facts about RIT taken
from [their website][1] (emphasis mine):

> The RIT student body consists of approximately 15,000 undergraduate and 2,900 graduate students.
> Enrolled students represent all 50 states and more than 100 countries. RIT is an **internationally
> recognized leader in preparing deaf and hard-of-hearing students** for successful careers in
> professional and technical fields. The university provides **unparalleled access and support
> services** for the more than **1,300 deaf and hard-of-hearing students** who live, study, and work
> with hearing students on the RIT campus.

The same page lists additional benefits for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students, such as paying
reduced tuition. In addition, RIT is also cognizant of how deaf students may not be able to or may
not want to use a traditional phone. When they provide a phone number for prospective students to
call and ask questions, there is an alternative videophone number to call. A videophone is similar
to Skype, except it is often used to call a regular phone number and allows a sign language
interpreter to act as an intermediate messenger in relaying the hearing person&#8217;s voice over to
the deaf person&#8217;s eye, and in some cases, relaying the deaf person&#8217;s signing to the
hearing person&#8217;s ears.

Hence why I was forced to make a unique decision. On the one hand, I had a spot at a college that
was ranked number one not just for small colleges, but for all American universities for two
consecutive years (2010 and 2011) in the Forbes college rankings. On top of that, Williams had a
renowned mathematics program, which was my intended major at the time of applying (I did not
consider the computer science major seriously until my second year). But on the other hand, I knew
that because they had no experience with deaf students, that I would have to continually advocate
for myself and explain what was necessary to allow me to succeed. That presumably would not be a
problem at a place like RIT which as mentioned earlier has over a thousand such students and has
a whole staff of sign language interpreters employed by the college. The social aspect was also
a positive for RIT; I can communicate with other students in sign language if necessary and have
an easier time engaging in group discussions as compared to a situation with hearing students. I
had to consider how much my family would pay. A Williams education costs significantly more than
an RIT education (even with my needs-based financial aid), and I also received the best
available scholarship for an RIT student, which would have reduced tuition to just a few
thousand dollars a year. How, then, did I decide to attend Williams College? And after a few
years of being able to reconsider my situation, can I say I pleased with my decision? Are there
other things I&#8217;ve learned from RIT that affected my stance? I&#8217;ll investigate most of
these questions in future blog entries.

Today, I want to focus on what I&#8217;ve learned from RIT and its accommodations over the past few
years. Notice my wording earlier about RIT&#8217;s advantages. I mentioned that these
are *advertised advantages.* But what is advertised may sometimes gloss over the truth, and I hope
to shed light on this issue. As a disclaimer, please don&#8217;t view this article as an attack on
RIT, even though it may seem like that occasionally. I still have an enormous amount of respect for
RIT providing this much assistance to DHH students. I just want to emphasize that RIT, like any
university, is not a &#8220;Utopia.&#8221; There are flaws in their accommodation policies system
that I would like to point out. Many of them can be fixed.

But since I am not a student there, how much information can I know about RIT? And is it fair to
emphasize my view of RIT, which is no doubt different from those of many other DHH students?
I&#8217;ll present my case here and you can be the judge. First, I have visited the RIT campus many
times, most notably during the summer before my senior year of high school. I participated in a
weeklong residential program for prospective DHH students. Furthermore, I have also gleaned insight
from other RIT students. Outside of Williams, I probably know more students at RIT than any other
college. I have had the fortune of being able to interact with many DHH RIT students in my life,
such as those hailing from my high school or the Summer Academy. Finally, my brother is a student
there. Like me, he&#8217;s also deaf, and we have similar academic interests. Both of us are
computer science majors and will be working at REUs this summer. But his experience at RIT thus far
has revealed some inadequacies in their access services. I now focus on two of them in particular.

One of the defining points of RIT is its accommodation policies. On paper, if a deaf student
requests interpreting services for a class, he or she should get it. What&#8217;s not entirely clear
is whether a deaf student can have these services for classes that have *multiple sections*. During
his first quarter at RIT, my brother wanted to enroll in a psychology elective course. As is the
case in many universities, psychology is a popular subject, and the introductory course has multiple
sections. Unfortunately, only one of the four or so sections offered that quarter had ASL (American
Sign Language) support. The session with ASL services was in a poor time slot; it met just once per
week from 6:00 to 10:00 PM. Furthermore, my brother had to take a required computer programming
course the following morning


Now, you could argue that my brother had to live with this schedule.  But if a hearing student
wanted to maximize his or her study productivity and flexibility, it makes sense that such a student
would sign up for a psychology course in a better time. DHH students are therefore denied the
ability to have schedule flexibility. What RIT really tries to do is save money by packing as many
DHH students in one section as possible. When my family tried to resolve this issue by emailing my
brother&#8217;s academic advisor and the disability services department, we got no response. (The
academic advisor, by the way, has to help about 700 students and can only offer generic high-level
advice, which isn&#8217;t my idea of a helpful advisor.) After a week of negotiation and getting
dangerously close to the start of the quarter, my brother was finally able to get services for a
better class time after we emailed the Provost of the College with a lengthy written request.
Discussions with other deaf RIT students &#8212; such as my brother&#8217;s roommate &#8212;
confirmed these sentiments that RIT can &#8220;hurt&#8221; their schedule by forcing them to take
classes at possibly undesirable time frames. I fortunately do not have this problem at Williams
College, because the policy there is that I pick my courses, and the accommodations are then built
in for me, not the other way around.

A second issue is that RIT&#8217;s classes can sometimes violate their own principles. During the
spring 2013 quarter, my brother enrolled in an elective course about Viking history. Unfortunately,
the class violated RIT&#8217;s accommodation policies. About half (literally) of the Viking history
class time was devoted to watching movies that had no closed captioning. (This, by the way, seems
ridiculous to me &#8212; why waste half of valuable lecture time watching movies?) This is despite
how RIT has a rule stating that [videos shown in class need to be captioned][2]. When grading is
weighted so heavily on participation and understanding movies, how is that class not able to escape
such a basic requirement for deaf students? As every deaf student should know, sign language
interpreters and other popular accommodations such as CART are no substitute for captioning. So I am
certainly a little confused about this situation.

Even worse, when my brother wanted to drop the course, he couldn’t because the drop
period (one week from the start of school) had passed.  The course was taught in one
four-hour session each week, and my brother learned in the second class that uncaptioned
movies would be routine for half the class time.  My brother’s only option was to
withdraw from the course, but he would have received a &#8220;W&#8221; on his
transcript, which would indicate to future employers that he was struggling in class due
to his academic deficiencies. (Hint: he wasn&#8217;t.) He then had to do a lot of
additional work to convince RIT to drop the class and avoid receiving an unjust
&#8220;W&#8221; on his transcript.  After another long and time-consuming effort, he was
finally allowed to drop the course.

The previous two scenarios indicate the difficulty my family experienced in trying to protect my
brother&#8217;s academic needs and rights. I don&#8217;t believe it should take a full family
struggle to achieve two basic academic rights. My parents know the intricacies of both RIT&#8217;s
policies and the American legal system and are willing to use this knowledge to achieve basic
rights. What about the many other students who do not have this advantage and do not know they can
petition to earn them? I suppose the message I want to send to prospective DHH students to RIT is
that, while for the most part you&#8217;ll have what you need, you will still be at a disadvantage
as compared to other hearing students and will continue to have to work extra hard to obtain
privileges that hearing students might take for granted.

On a final note, another unfortunate incidence has popped up relating to RIT&#8217;s accommodations
policies that I didn&#8217;t know of until the final draft of this post. I&#8217;m going to keep it
confidential until I know more information, but it might be something I&#8217;ll investigate later.
