When I need to use people's names in sign language, I have three tactics I can draw upon. The best
one is to invoke the person's "official" sign name. The second tactic is to take the first letter of
the person's first name (or last, depending on context) and gently shake it. I view this as a
generic way of signing someone's name when a sign has not been established. The third tactic is to
avoid a sign name all together and fingerspell.

It is not always possible to use the first tactic. When babies are born, we assign English names
right away, often having pre-determined them beforehand. But finding an appropriate name *sign* for
someone --- regardless of whether he or she is deaf or hearing --- requires many more years. This is
due to an informal rule that a person can only be given a name sign by someone who is "culturally
Deaf." In addition, as a practical manner, most name signs combine the first letter of the person's
first name and a personal characteristic. This is the case for *my* name sign, which is to form a
"D" in one's dominant hand and then to peck one's forehead twice. It's to indicate "intelligence."
Yes, I know it's embarrassing, and please don't use it in my presence. I don't know who gave it to
me.

For these reasons, the use of name signs in official ASL conversations is often restricted to people
who know each other well. The exception, of course, is with famous people. I got particularly
curious about one man's name sign when one of my high school sign language interpreters suggested it
in a recent conversation with me at a local Starbucks. That man is Donald Trump.

A Google search for "Donald Trump name signs" leads to an interesting [article from the Washington
Post][2], which describes not only a proposed name sign for Trump, but also signs for other notable
politicians: Bernie Sanders, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. Of all
the politicians listed, I have only used Obama's name sign, which I quite enjoy. It is quick enough
to use and represents his name with the beginning "O" along with the hand movement to indicate
America's flag. Quite conveniently, the (sideways) "B" that's used to represent the flag is also the
second letter in "Obama."

Name signs are hard to get. Other than politicians and religious figures, I can only remember using
a name sign for William Shakespeare. It involves moving one's dominant hand as if one is shaking a
small bag (since, you know, "shake" and *Shake*speare).

While the Washington Post certainly has a suitable name sign for Trump, I got curious and
investigated to see if there were alternatives. You can find plenty of proposals on YouTube videos.
Almost all are variations of making fun of Trump's hair, which should have been obvious in
retrospect.

[Here is a video I found][1] that, in my opinion, represents the best version of a Trump name sign.
It is a variation of the Washington Post's sign; it repeats the hand-waving motion of Trump's hair.
This is fine since it can be done quickly. That video has some other context to it, so for your
convenience, here's my English translation of it:

> Hi, Tad! You asked me, what is the sign name for Trump? Interesting. My husband and I discussed
> this and after a long time, we finally settled on a sign for him. Tonight, at the ASL SLAM
> [demonstrates sign], I was curious and asked everyone about a name sign for Trump. We had already
> settled on this one: [demonstrates sign] What do you think? [demonstrates sign again]

Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with his unorthodox policies, you have to admit that
this sign is appropriate.
