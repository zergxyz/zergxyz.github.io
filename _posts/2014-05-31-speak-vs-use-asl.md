Here&#8217;s an interesting question to consider: which one of &#8220;he/she/someone *uses*
ASL&#8221; or &#8220;he/she/someone *speaks* ASL&#8221; should you use in writing and conversation?
The answer isn&#8217;t obvious to most people without knowledge of ASL, because while *speak* is the
default term for most languages, it&#8217;s not clear if ASL falls under that category due to its
visual nature (and, I might add, its no-speaking requirement).

I never had someone tell me which of the two phrases to use, and I&#8217;ve flip-flopped on my
usage. I would say *speak* when I was younger, then in recent years I switched to saying *use,* and
now I&#8217;m starting to think I should go back to *speak*. My recent shift is due to a discussion
on the [Deaf Academics][1] mailing list.

[Here][2] is a video of someone arguing on behalf of *speak*, and here is the transcript (the
meaning of s5s is explained in the video):

> &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Michele Westfall and I currently write for ASL Rose. John Clark asked me to talk with you about Speak vs Sign, and I&#8217;m happy to do so. It&#8217;s no problem at all. Why? For the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve been encouraging Deaf people &#8230; really, **everyone** to use the word &#8220;speak&#8221; in relation to ASL. Why? I&#8217;ve been noticing that the hearing society frequently sees us as &#8220;silent.&#8221; Yes, they regard ASL as &#8220;beautiful,&#8221; but when it really counts and really comes down to it, we are still SILENT in their eyes. I&#8217;ve noticed that both hearing and Deaf people tend to say &#8220;ASL users&#8221;&#8230;and that bothers me.
> 
> Think about it: hearing people never say &#8220;English users&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;French users&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;Spanish users&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;Chinese users.&#8221; Really, the contrast is huge. We say &#8220;ASL users&#8221;, &#8220;we sign&#8221;, &#8220;we do ASL&#8221;&#8230;.which serves to emphasize the difference between ASL and all other voiced languages and puts way too much emphasis on the Voice. Hearing people get to say &#8220;speak&#8221;&#8230;and we can&#8217;t.
> 
> I disagree with that. I say, YES, we speak ASL. Understand, I&#8217;m not saying we have to say &#8220;We speak [using 4-handshape on chin] ASL.&#8221;  That&#8217;s wrong. What&#8217;s the right way? &#8220;We speak [using s-5-s handshape] ASL.&#8221; Get it? s5s = speak&#8230;that&#8217;s our version of speak. Don&#8217;t say 4-handshape on chin/speak. That&#8217;s the hearing version (or the hearing-minded version). We s5s/speak ASL. Or&#8230;&#8221;I&#8217;m an ASL s5s/person [speaker].&#8221; Or &#8220;The ASL s5s/person [speaker] for the day is XXXXX.&#8221;
> 
> Just an example. You s5s/speak ASL. I s5s/speak ASL. To let you know, I&#8217;ve been saying this for the past several years. I even write it&#8230;for example &#8220;I speak ASL.&#8221; on paper. In English sentence&#8230;.I speak ASL/you speak ASL. And hearing people always accept it and never object. They don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Wait a minute! What&#8217;s this?&#8221; They accept it because it seems natural to them. I think&#8230;it&#8217;s time. We&#8217;ve been saying all along that ASL is a language. It means we must change our words to reflect that reality. What&#8217;s our reality? ASL is our language, and therefore&#8230;what? We speak ASL!  We don&#8217;t sign ASL.
> 
> Saying &#8220;We sign ASL&#8221; gives way too much credit/weight to Voice. No. Enough. It&#8217;s time to bring ASL on equal footing with all other voiced languages. You speak ASL. I speak ASL. We don&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; ASL. We don&#8217;t &#8220;use&#8221; ASL. We speak ASL. We are ASL speakers. I hope this makes sense to you. If not, let me know. Bye bye.&#8221;
