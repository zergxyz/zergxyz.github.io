After a semester-long sabbatical, I&#8217;m back to Project Euler in my never-ending quest to answer
all of their (at the moment) 432 questions. Just recently, I solved my 82nd problem ([XOR
decryption][1]) but noticed that Project Euler has added a new message to the bottom of the page one
receives after successfully completing a question. (Click the image below to enlarge.)

With the growth of Project Euler, it&#8217;s no surprise that there have been some people who, for
whatever reason, take pleasure in taking answers distributed from online websites and plugging them
in just to increase their solutions count.

Still, I wish this message wasn&#8217;t necessary. If one really wants to have an &#8220;aha!&#8221;
moment, he or she should simply avoid websites or blogs that publish solutions and restrict web
access to neutral sites such as Wikipedia.Â I have discussed Project Euler questions on this blog in
the past (see [this][3] and [this][4]), and I would like to continue doing so in the future, since
some of them are intellectually stimulating. Perhaps I should add a huge message at the start of
each such post warning &#8220;unsuspecting&#8221; visitors?
