I just made seven blog entries last June. That&#8217;s how many I had in the rest of 2012 combined,
so it&#8217;s clear that I must be doing something different in the summer than during the spring
semester.

The obvious answer is that I&#8217;m not faced with the overwhelming academic demands of Williams
College. While I am working full time at Bard, I&#8217;m definitely laboring for fewer hours as
compared to spring semester. And often, my work consists of twiddling my thumbs and rereading
academic papers while I wait for a lengthy experiment to conclude. At the time of this writing, for
instance, I have two processes running on my computer that I expect to take about ten hours to
complete. Sadly, I haven&#8217;t shut down my lab computer in about a week.

But the deeper answer is that I have gotten more motivated about writing and have consequently been
diligent in setting aside serious writing time. Even though I was inundated with coursework and
applications last semester, there were still periods of time, like the entire Winter Study period,
that were just ripe for writing. Yet I didn&#8217;t blog much, preferring to follow and play
basketball, play Minecraft, and do other activities. But writing a blog, even if it doesn&#8217;t
receive much attention, has a certain appeal that games lack. The lasting impression of written work
I produce, by its very nature, affords me an opportunity to look back and see how my interests have
developed and vacillated throughout my undergraduate years. And this is also practice for an
activity that I will be performing often in life, whether it be for scholarship applications, formal
emails, manuscripts, or other documents. By writing often, I feel like I experience hidden
reservoirs of enjoyment. Those are especially prevalent during days when I don&#8217;t have much to
do for the night, and want to make use of precious time.

I hope to maintain this rate of posting during my junior year of college. Since I won&#8217;t have a
roommate, it&#8217;s easier for me to have my own sleeping schedule. My preliminary plan is to wake
up much, much earlier than the 9:30 to 11:00 AM time that was the norm during my sophomore year, and
use the early morning as study time. By doing more work before classes, I hope to easily set aside
blogging time several nights a week.

On a general note, my recent surge in posting just shows that the more you like an activity or
subject, the more productive you will be. That is why I need to make sure that I am deeply
passionate about whatever computer science field I intend to study in the future.
