Yesterday represented a historic moment for America as the Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage
nationwide. I'm happy and proud at this result, because I supported same sex marriage and gay rights
ever since I first learned about the issue. This was back in 2007, *before* prominent Democrats
such as [President Obama](http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/politics/obama-same-sex-marriage/) and the
soon-to-be 2016 presidential candidate [Hillary
Clinton](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/)
explicitly pledged their support.

As I ponder about the ruling and its various consequences, I'm noticing from Facebook and other
sources (e.g., [Scott Aaronson's blog](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2346)) that support for
same sex marriage is practically universal among computer scientists in academia. To this day, I
have yet to have one come to me stating that he/she opposed same sex marriage.

Yet this signals an interesting paradox.

What's one of the biggest concerns regarding diversity in computer science? *That there are too many
Caucasian (and Asian) males[^diversity]!*

And what's one of the most notable characteristics regarding the Republican party --- now infamously
known as the *anti-gay* party[^jindal]? *That there are too many Caucasian males[^males]!*

So how come academics support same sex marriage?

I am a biracial, White and Asian male, and view myself as a moderate Democrat, so I am probably one
of many examples of this paradox. Perhaps I can offer some opinions on why this is present:

- [Academia is
  liberal](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Professors-Liberal-Conservatives-Care/dp/0674059093). This is
  not controversial, with notable political figures stating that universities are liberal bastions.
  As Michael Bloomberg [commented in his Harvard 2014 commencement
  speech](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/29/us/bloomberg-harvard-speech/), *ninety-six* percent of all
  faculty campaign donations for the 2012 U.S. presidential election race went to Obama[^bloomberg].
  Computer science just happens to be one subfield of academia, and there is no obvious reason why
  we should be more liberal or less liberal than other fields.

- Computer science is also a subfield of, well, *science*, and being a well-educated scientist is
  inversely correlated with religious fervor (and positively correlated with athiesm), which is then
  positively correlated with support for same sex marriage. Richard Dawkins, in his
  thought-provoking book [The God
  Delusion](http://www.amazon.com/The-God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0618918248), eloquently
  dissects these observations and their subsequent consequences. By the way, I highly recommend his
  book.

- Here's a reason that's specific to our field: one of the founders of computer science was Alan
  Turing, who was arguably one of the most important gay figures in history[^gay_men]. His story ---
  that of being the most important British code-breaker during World War II, one of the pioneers of
  comptuer science ... and being prosecuted for displaying homosexual behavior *in private*
  (really?), and then committing suicide --- is heart wrenching to digest. [The Imitation
  Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/), while not the most factually accurate account of his
  life, shows how our opinions of homosexuals has changed over the past few decades. I don't think
  it's a coincidence that some prominent Republicans who support same sex marriage have a gay
  relative[^examples]. Perhaps computer scientists feel an obligation to respect the father of the
  field.

There's a lot more that I'd like to cover, but for now I'm taking pleasure in the current ruling and
thinking about the consequences. Hopefully we'll see other countries continue to follow suit. I'm
really wondering about what will happen to Japan, the country of origin for my father's family.
There's a [really nice map of LGBT rights by country or territory on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory), but there's not a
whole lot of dark blue (I think that's the color for marriage ... I'm colorblind) by Asia.  I don't
know why Asian countries seem to lag behind the curve in gay rights. Still, as I look at how much
attitudes have changed in recent times, perhaps it's not too far-fetched to suggest that within
fifty years, same sex marriage will be legal in Japan (as well as China and South Korea).  Actually,
one might be able to make a reasonable argument for every country except North Korea and the Middle
Eastern ones.

We'll see what the future holds.

[^diversity]: The issue of diversity in computer science and other STEM fields has been well-documented,
    and a quick Google search will lead to [articles such as this
    one](http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/01/16/addressing-ethnic-diversity-in-computer-science/).

[^jindal]: And yes, Governor Jindal, [staying firm against gay
    marriage](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/opinion/bobby-jindal-im-holding-firm-against-gay-marriage.html)
    will only continue to damage the image of the Republican Party and deter young voters like me.
    Ironically, Governor Jindal is Indian-American, and Asians tend to vote Democratic.

[^males]: [The Pew Research center](http://www.pewresearch.org/topics/political-party-affiliation/)
    is one possible source for learning about the breakdown of party affiliation among various
    demographic categories.

[^bloomberg]: By the way, Michael Bloomberg *also* delivered the 2014 Williams College commencement
    speech, so I saw him in person. He did not mention the issue of liberal academia; instead, he
    talked about cracking down on the illegal gun market.

[^gay_men]: Seeing [lists of important gay people like
    these](http://www.ranker.com/list/famous-gay-men-list-of-gay-men-throughout-history/famous-gay-and-lesbian?&var=2)
    perplexes me. These lists should only contain people whose sexuality is *known without a doubt*.
    Alan Turing fits this criteria; guys like Leonardo da Vinci (really?) do not.

[^examples]: I can immediately think of several right off the bat: [Rob
    Portman](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/editorials/2013/03/15/gay-couples-also-deserve-chance-to-get-married.html),
    [Charlie
    Baker](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/15/gop-candidate-for-mass-governor-plays-up-support-for-gay-brother-video/),
    and [Dick
    Cheney](http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/11/dick-cheney-actively-supports-gay-marriage-non-campaign-years/71721/).
