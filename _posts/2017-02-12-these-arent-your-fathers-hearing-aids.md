I am now wearing [Oticon Dynamo hearing aids][1]. The good news is that I've
[run many times with them][2] and so far have not had issues with water
resistance.

However, I wanted to bring up a striking point that really made me realize about
how our world has changed remarkably in the last few years.

A few months ago, when I was first fitted with the hearing aids, my audiologist
set the default volume level to be "on target" for me. The hearing aid is
designed to provide different amounts of power to people depending on their raw
hearing level. There's a volume control on it which goes from "1" (weak) to "4"
(powerful), which I can easily adjust as I wish. The baseline setting is "3",
but this baseline is what audiologist adjust on a case-by-case basis. This means
my "3" (and thus, my "1" and "4" settings) may be more powerful, less powerful,
or the same compared to the respective settings for someone else.

When my audiologist first fit the hearing aids for me, I felt that my left
hearing aid was too quiet and my right one too loud by default, so she modified
the baselines. 

She also, critically, gave me about a week to adjust to the hearing aids, and I
was to report back on whether its strength was correctly set.

During that week, I wore the hearing aids, but I then decided that I was
originally mistaken about both hearing aids, since I had to repeatedly
*increase* the volume for the left one and *decrease* the volume for the right
one.

I reported back to my audiologist and said that she was right all along, and
that my baselines needed to be back to their default levels. She was able to
corroborate my intuition by showing me --- amazingly -- *how often I had
adjusted the hearing aid volume level*, and *in which direction*.

Hearing aids are, apparently, now fitted with these advanced sensors so they can
track exactly how you adjust them (volume controls or otherwise). 

The lesson is that just about everything nowadays consists of *sensors*, a point
which is highlighted in Thomas L. Friedman's excellent book *[Thank You for
Being Late][4]*. It is also a characteristic of what computer scientists refer
to as the "[Internet of Things][3]."

Obviously, these certainly aren't the hearing aids your father wore when he was
young.
