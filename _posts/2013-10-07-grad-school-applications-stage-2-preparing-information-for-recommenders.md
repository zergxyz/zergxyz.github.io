Back in July, I [published a post][1] proclaiming the start of my fall 2013 graduate school applications process.

Now that it&#8217;s the start of October, I can safely say that I&#8217;m at a new stage: the point where I need to provide information to all my reference writers about my applications. Don&#8217;t neglect this non-trivial step! Letters of recommendations are probably the third most important aspect of one&#8217;s application after one&#8217;s research experience and grades (in that order), and they become extremely useful in picking out the best of the best.

Here&#8217;s what I included in my &#8220;packet&#8221; of information to my recommenders:

1. A copy of my updated curriculum vitae. This should be something everyone does.

2. A document that clearly outlines all of the programs to which I&#8217;m applying, as well as any other fellowships and/or scholarships. For me, this is ten Ph.D. programs, four fellowships, and three outside scholarships, and my document ended up being six pages. This includes a LaTeX-generated table of contents and a separate page devoted to an Introduction. For each application, I also included a web link, just in case my reference writers wanted some extra information. Finally, for each school, I also indicated the labs and professors that caught my interest.

I think the last point is something that &#8212; sadly &#8212; often gets glossed over when sending information to recommenders. It&#8217;s not just enough to say that one wants to study at a school; one also should have a general idea of the different research groups at an institution and which ones suit himself or herself the best.

One thing that I had hoped to include in the packet was an updated statement of purpose. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t found the time to get a sensible essay ready, so that&#8217;s the next thing on my agenda to send to my recommenders.

It was a relief to finally send information to my three recommenders, so now I can focus on getting my actual essays and applications. No, I&#8217;m not as far as I hoped to be in the plan I posted in July, but I&#8217;m getting there. I still have a couple of weeks before the first deadlines arrive&#8230;
