Unfortunately, my next round of midterms is coming. I have 4 midterms in the span of 7 days, with one being a 48-hour take-home exam. The agenda:

1. Don&#8217;t panic (obviously!)  
2. Use the quiz-and-recall method, rather than read mindlessly from notes  
3. Don&#8217;t stop until every single problem or concept is understood*  
4. Get those 1-page sheets ready for exams that allow 1 page of notes  
5. Finish any homework first, then study  
6. Walk away from the material if it&#8217;s confusing  
7. Do the practice exams

*Naturally, I&#8217;ll have to make some adjustments on what I think will or will not be tested on these exams.

I&#8217;ll hope to utilize #2 most often, but #6 will be what affects my well-being the most. I need to know when to walk away from the material or when to continue bashing through a problem like a group of soldiers breaking through a castle. The former alleviates stress, while the latter may contribute to it. If a problem gets solved (i.e. achieved), the latter will have a far greater benefit.

It starts &#8230; Tuesday.
