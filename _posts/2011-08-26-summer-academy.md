I spent much of the summer of 2011 at the University of Washington at Seattle as part of the Summer
Academy for Advancing Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing in Computing. (Will they ever change that name so it
isn&#8217;t a mouthful???) It&#8217;s a nine-week residential program that brings 13 deaf and
hard-of-hearing students together who take courses and attend talks together. I was one of those
students, along with my brother. When I first heard about the program, I had mixed feelings. I
didn&#8217;t consider myself as a computer science person, and I felt like this program
wouldn&#8217;t match my interests. But what was once a near last-choice summer experience may have
unintentionally, yet incredibly, led me to gravitate towards computer science as a major.

You can read the description of the program [on the web][1] (alternatively, just Google search
Summer Academy Deaf and Hard of Hearing) so I won&#8217;t explain everything. However, it
wasn&#8217;t like being at Williams, since there were only 2 classes there compared with 4 at my
college. What this program offered that I hadn&#8217;t experienced before was the opportunity to see
what current computer science graduate students and workers were doing. Graduate students presented
their topics, ranging from Android programs to touch-screens for blind people, while people in
industry talked about their experience and jobs, which typically involved software engineering or
information technology.

We&#8217;ll see how this program impacts me in the future. Check back in five years.

In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to read more about the ultra-popular computer game &#8212; not just
at the Summer Academy but global &#8212; *Minecraft* and it&#8217;s upcoming 1.8 version. I
can&#8217;t wait&#8230;.
