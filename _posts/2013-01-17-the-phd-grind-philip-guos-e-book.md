Today, I read Philip Guo&#8217;s e-book *[The Ph.D. Grind][2]. *It&#8217;s completely free (just
visit the link and download) and it&#8217;s fairly easy reading, so one should be able to finish in
about an hour or two. After reading it, I was both enlightened and impressed. The book seemed to
accomplish its goals: provide a clear &#8212; but not overly detailed &#8212; account of a computer
science graduate student&#8217;s journey to obtain a Ph.D. (Philip Guo was a Ph.D. student at
Stanford University.) One of the reasons why I like it is that the author included many examples of
how he struggled during his first three years of his Ph.D. program, and more importantly,
*why *those struggles occurred. By the end of the book, I was pondering to myself: *can I avoid the
pitfalls he encountered, and intelligently grind away at a publishable* *project*? As you can tell,
some amount of &#8220;grinding&#8221; is necessary; otherwise, you&#8217;ll never make any progress.
But if you go entirely on the wrong track &#8212; that is, if you&#8217;re working hours and hours
by yourself on a famous professor&#8217;s project without any direction &#8212; that&#8217;s not a
good idea.

Possibly more than anything else, *The Ph.D. Grind* taught me the value of (at least initially)
working with *assistant professors and postdoctoral researchers.* The reason is quite simple.

*They are the ones under the most pressure to publish.*

The assistant professor needs to publish for tenure; the postdoc needs to publish to *get* an
assistant professorship. Now, that&#8217;s *not* to say a Ph.D. student should *never* pick a
tenured professor to be an advisor &#8230; it&#8217;s just that the student might want to be part of
a research group that&#8217;s composed of at least one non-tenured faculty.

Some of my quick thoughts after reading this book include:

  1. I absolutely, positively want to get a graduate fellowship.
  2. I should talk with all assistant professors at whatever university I&#8217;m at (for graduate school) and offer my services.
  3. I cannot, unless circumstances are extremely unexceptional, work all day on a project
  4. Aim for top-tier conference publications earlier; it makes the process of actually writing the thesis a formality.

To wrap things up, I recommend *The Ph.D. Grind *especially to undergraduates who are considering
pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science. Again, it&#8217;s free and easy to read.
