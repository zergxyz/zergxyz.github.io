I just read *Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue*, by renowned atheist [Sam Harris][1] and
former jihadist-turned-liberal-activist [Maajid Nawaz][2]. I had this book on my radar for a while,
and decided to read it yesterday in the wake of the tragic news of the recent Orlando shootings. My
hope is to better understand what drives people to extremism and how we can reduce the probability
of similar attacks from occurring.

I first found out about the book from browsing the website of Sam Harris, one of the four "[New
Atheists][5]." Harris and I see eye-to-eye on a number of issues. The most obvious one is that we
are atheists. In addition, we both support LGBT rights, scientific reasoning, [taxing
billionaires][6], and we disapprove of the Iraq war. I do not claim to agree with everything he
says, of course. Indeed, some of Harris's statements have been controversial (as one would expect
when dealing with religion). He actually felt compelled to write [a blog post][3] to respond to
controversy.

As of this writing, *Islam and the Future of Tolerance* is Harris' most recent book, but the
interesting thing is that it's actually a dialogue with Maajid Nawaz, listed as the book's
co-author. Nawaz has a remarkable personal story, which he describes in his 2013 autobiography
*Radical: My Journey Out Of Islamist Extremism*.  Nawaz was born in Britain, but after experiencing
personal grievances (including racism), he joined the radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. After
an arrest in Egypt, he turned his life around by rejecting radical Islam. Today, he is of the
world's foremost liberal Muslims and a key challenger to extremism.

*Islam and the Future of Tolerance* is a conversation between Harris and Nawaz about Islam. Harris
is skeptical that Nawaz can achieve the goal of reforming Islam.  Harris, however, concedes that
people like Nawaz --- and not "infidels" like himself --- are the ones who have to do the job. How
can the faith reformation happen? What will be the future of Islam?  That is the subject of their
dialogue. Here are some of the highlights of their conversation, outlined according to the section:

- **The Roots of Extremism**. This is a short section where Nawaz provides an abbreviated version of
  his autobiography.

- **The Scope of the Problem**. Here's the key takeaway: a primary issue with getting Muslims and
  non-Muslims to ally together is that the largest group of Muslims, which Harris and Nawaz call
  "religiously conservative Muslims", do not wholeheartedly support contemporary liberal human
  rights. Thus, while those Muslims would be our allies against the Islamic State, they would also
  resist our efforts in promoting women's rights, LGBT rights, etc.

- **The Power of Belief**. Harris asks Nawaz how he originally became radicalized. Was it due to
  "ordinary" grievances that might be corrected with more tolerance (e.g., turning to radical Islam
  due to racism from non-Muslims?), or due to deeper forces such as martyrdom? I have frequently
  wondered about this process because, as an atheist, I struggle to understand how something like
  religion (in its most extreme form) can systematically guide people towards terror, barbarianism,
  and destruction.

- **The Betrayal of Liberalism**. Both Harris and Nawaz slam liberals for their adherence to
  "political correctness." (Donald Trump would be proud of them.) In the previous chapter, Harris
  rips liberal scholars who say that the West is to blame for the problems in Middle Eastern
  societies. Harris and Nawaz point out one unfortunate consequence of political correctness: that
  only right-wing bigots are accurately assessing jihadists nowadays. 

- **The Nature of Islam**. Harris argues that most of our human rights progress in the last few
  centuries is *despite* the presence of religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and (especially)
  Islam. There are plenty of religious moderates, but Harris argues that these moderates somehow
  have to filter out the more dangerous parts of their scripture. Harris concludes that the purest
  interpretation of reading scripture --- and therefore leaving out personal biases --- would
  actually *favor* the Islamic State:

> This is why the approach of a group like the Islamic State has a certain intellectual appeal
> (which, admittedly, sounds strange to say) because the most straightforward reading of scripture
> suggests that Allah advises jihadists to take sex slaves from among the conquered, decapitate
> their enemies, and so forth.

- **Finding the Way Forward**. Most of this section concerns the [fatwa against the Islamic
  State][7]. Harris and Nawaz, while recognizing that a fatwa is better than no fatwa, have
  reservations because it belies the true issues with Islamic tolerance. Near the end, Harris and
  Nawaz talk about the heavily American phenomenon of "being at war with Islam." Harris admits that
  he may have played a role in assisting that culture, and Nawaz argues that President Obama must
  start naming the enemy *radical Islam* (I believe Nawaz is correct on this, but I also believe too
  much has been made out of this).
  
Despite the book's brevity, I feel like both men were able to make good points. The conversation
as a whole, while certainly not being a substitute for a more rigorous study of the role of religion
in history, provides some interesting highlights. I learned about several historical events and
spent some time browsing the corresponding Wikipedia pages to learn more.

One of my biggest takeaways from the book is that I doubt if liberals are effectively handling the
problem of radical Islam. Harris and Nawaz, while both being liberals (in the sense that they would
vote Democratic in the United States), would argue that liberals are *not* doing a good job. But they
would also have that opinion of the conservative response.

But there's something more important I need to mention. I think this conversation is useful because
it shows how how people with different religious beliefs can come together and have a friendly,
reasonable discussion without ripping each other's throats. Nawaz is not *that* religious, but we
need to have a starting point for a honest conversations with Muslims, and this dialogue serves that
role effectively. In the wake of the Orlando shootings, these conversations give me hope that
humanity will grow more peaceful and more tolerant in the coming years.  Having an open mind is
incredibly important. As Nawaz concludes:

> Allow me to to take this opportunity to also thank you, Sam. It isn't easy for anyone to reach
> across divides --- real or imagined --- and try to hold a sensible dialogue amid so much
> background noise and confusion. You will no doubt be censured by some Islam critics for not
> insisting that I am in fact a closet jihadist, just as I will be criticized by many Muslims for
> having this conversation with you.

Thanks to Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz for having this conversation.
