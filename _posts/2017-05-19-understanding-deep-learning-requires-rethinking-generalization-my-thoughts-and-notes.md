The paper "Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization"
([arXiv link][1]) caused quite a stir in the Deep Learning and Machine Learning
research communities. It's the rare paper that seems to have high research merit
--- judging from being awarded one of three *Best Paper* awards at [ICLR
2017][3] --- but is *also* readable. Hence, it got the most amount of comments
of any ICLR 2017 submission on [OpenReview][2]. It has also been discussed on
[reddit][4] and was recently featured on [*The Morning Paper*][5] blog.  I was
aware of the paper shortly after it was uploaded to arXiv, but never found the
time to read it in detail until now. 

I enjoyed reading the paper, and while I agree with many readers that some of
the findings might be obvious, the paper nonetheless seems deserving of the
attention it has been getting.

The authors conveniently put two of their important findings in centered
italics:

> Deep neural networks easily fit random labels.

and

> Explicit regularization may improve generalization performance, but is neither
> necessary nor by itself sufficient for controlling generalization error.

I will also quote another contribution from the paper that I find interesting:

> We complement our empirical observations with a theoretical construction
> showing that generically large neural networks can express any labeling of the
> training data.

(I go through the derivation later in this post.)

Going back to their first claim about deep neural networks fitting random
labels, what does this mean from a *generalization perspective*?
(Generalization is just the difference between training error and testing
error.) It means that we cannot come up with a "generalization function" that
can take in a neural network as input and output a generalization quality score.
Here's my intuition:

- **What we want**: let's imagine an arbitrary encoding of a neural network
  designed to give as much deterministic information as possible, such as the
  architecture and hyperparameters, and then use that encoding as input to a
  generalization function. We want that function to give us a number
  representing generalization quality, assuming that the datasets are allowed to
  vary. The worst generalization occurs when a fixed neural network gets
  excellent training error but could get either the *same* testing error
  (awesome!), or get test-set performance no better than *random guessing*
  (ugh!).

- **Reality**: unfortunately, the best we can do seems to be no better than the
  worst case. We know of no function that can provide bounds on generalization
  performance across all datasets. Why? Let's use the LeNet architecture and
  MNIST as an example. With the right architecture, generalization error is very
  small as both training and testing performance are in the high 90 percentages.
  With a second data set that consists of the *same* MNIST digits, but with the
  *labels randomized*, that same LeNet architecture can do no better than random
  guessing on the test set, even though the *training* performance is extremely
  good (or at least, it should be). That's *literally* as bad as we can get.
  There's no point in developing a function to measure generalization when we
  know it can only tell us that generalization will be in between zero (i.e.
  perfect) and the difference between zero and random guessing (i.e. the worst
  case)!

As they later discuss in the paper, regularization can be used to improve
generalization, but will not be sufficient for developing our desired
generalization criteria.

Let's briefly take a step back and consider classical machine learning, which
provides us with generalization criteria such as VC-dimension, Rademacher
complexity, and uniform stability. I learned about VC-dimension during my
undergraduate machine learning class, Rademacher complexity during STAT 210B
this past semester, and ... actually I'm not familiar with uniform stability.
But *intuitively* ... it makes sense to me that classical criteria do not apply
to deep networks. To take the Rademacher complexity example: a function class
which can fit to arbitrary $$\pm 1$$ noise vectors presents the trivial bound of
one, which is like saying: "generalization is between zero and the worst case."
Not very helpful.

The paper then proceeds to describe their testing scenario, and packs some
important results in the figure reproduced below:

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/understanding_dl_rethinking_gen.png"> </p>

This figure represents a neural network classifying the images in the
widely-benchmarked CIFAR-10 dataset.  The network the authors used is a
simplified version of the Inception architecture.

- The first subplot represents five different settings of the labels and input
  images.  To be clear on what the "gaussian" setting means, they use a Gaussian
  distribution to generate *random pixels* (!!) for every image. The mean and
  variance of that Gaussian are "matched to the original dataset." In addition,
  the "shuffled" and "random" pixels apply a random permutation to the pixels,
  with the *same* permutation to all images for the former, and *different*
  permutations for the latter.
  
  We immediately see that the neural network can get zero training error on
  *all* the settings, but the convergence speed varies. Intuition suggests that
  the dataset with the correct labels and the one with the same shuffling
  permutation should converge quickly, and this indeed is the case.
  Interestingly enough, I thought the "gaussian" setting would have the worst
  performance, but that prize seems to go to "random labels."

- The second subplot measures training error when the amount of label noise is
  varied; with some probability $$p$$, each image independently has its labeled
  corrupted and replaced with a draw from the discrete uniform distribution over
  the classes.  The results show that more corruption slows convergence, which
  makes sense.  By the way, using a continuum of something is a common research
  tactic and something I should try for my own work.

- Finally, the third subplot measures generalization error under label
  corruption. As these data points were all measured *after* convergence, this
  is equivalent to the test error. The results here also make a lot of sense.
  Test set error should be approaching 90 percent because CIFAR-10 has 10
  classes (that's why it's called CIFAR-10!).

My major criticism of this figure is *not* that the results, particularly in the
second and third subplots, might seem obvious but that the figure *lacks error
bars*. Since it's easy nowadays to program multiple calls in a bash script or
something similar, I would expect at least three trials and with error bars (or
"regions") to each curve in this figure.

The next section discusses the role of regularization, which is normally
applied to prevent overfitting to the training data. The classic example is with
linear regression and a dataset of several points arranged in roughly a linear
fashion. Do we try to fit a straight line through these points, which might have
lots of training error, or do we take a high-dimensional polynomial and fit
*every* point exactly, even if the resulting curve looks impossibly crazy?
That's what regularization helps to control. Explicit regularization in linear
regression is the $$\lambda$$ term in the following optimization problem:

$$\min_w \|Xw - y\|_2^2 + \lambda \|w\|_2^2$$

I presented this [in an earlier blog post][6]. 

To investigate the role of regularization in Deep Learning, the authors test
with and without regularizers. Incidentally, the use of $$\lambda$$ above is not
the only type of regularization. There are also several others: **data
augmentation**, **dropout**, **weight decay**, **early stopping** (implicit) and
**batch normalization** (implicit). These are standard tools in the modern Deep
Learning toolkit.

They find that, while regularization helps to improve generalization
performance, it is still possible to get excellent generalization even with *no*
regularization. They conclude:

> In summary, our observations on both explicit and implicit regularizers are
> consistently suggesting that regularizers, when properly tuned, could help to
> improve the generalization performance. However, it is unlikely that the
> regularizers are the fundamental reason for generalization, as the networks
> continue to perform well after all the regularizers [are] removed.

On a side note, the regularization discussion in the paper feels out of order
and the writing sounds a bit off to me. I wish they had more time to fix this,
as the regularization portion of the paper contains most of my English
language-related criticism.

Moving on, the next section of the paper is about **finite-sample
expressivity**, or understanding what functions neural networks can express
*given a finite number of samples*. The authors state that the previous
literature focuses on *population analysis* where one can assume an arbitrary
number of samples. Here, instead, they assume a *fixed* set of $$n$$ training
points $$\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$$. This seems easier to understand anyway.

They prove a theorem that relates to the third major contribution I wrote
earlier: "that generically large neural networks can express any labeling of the
training data." Before proving the theorem, let's begin with the following
lemma:

> **Lemma 1.** For any two interleaving sequences of $$n$$ real numbers 
> 
> $$b_1 < x_1 < b_2 < x_2 \cdots < b_n < x_n$$
>
> the $$n \times n$$ matrix $$A = [\max\{x_i - b_j, 0\}]_{ij}$$ has full rank.
> Its smallest eigenvalue is $$\min_i (x_i - b_i)$$.

Whenever I see statements like these, my first instinct is to draw out the
matrix. And here it is:

$$
\begin{align}
A &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\max\{x_1-b_1, 0\} & \max\{x_1-b_2, 0\} & \cdots & \max\{x_1-b_n, 0\} \\
\max\{x_2-b_1, 0\} & \max\{x_2-b_2, 0\} & \cdots & \max\{x_2-b_n, 0\} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\max\{x_n-b_1, 0\} & \max\{x_n-b_2, 0\} & \cdots & \max\{x_n-b_n, 0\}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&\;{\overset{(i)}{=}}\;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1-b_1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
x_2-b_1 & x_2-b_2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n-1}-b_1 & x_{n-1}-b_2 & \ddots & \cdots & 0 \\
x_n-b_1 & x_n-b_2 & x_n-b_3 & \cdots & x_n-b_n
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

where (i) follows from the interleaving sequence assumption. This matrix is
lower-triangular, and moreover, all the non-zero elements are positive. We know
from linear algebra that lower triangular matrices

- are invertible if and only if the diagonal elements are nonzero
- have their eigenvalues taken directly from the diagonal elements

These two facts together prove Lemma 1.  Next, we can prove:

> **Theorem 1**. There exists a two-layer neural network with ReLU activations
> and $$2n + d$$ weights that can represent any function on a sample of size
> $$n$$ in $$d$$ dimensions.

Consider the function

$$
c(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j \cdot \max\{a^Tx-b_j,0\}
$$

with $$w, b \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ and $$a,x\in \mathbb{R}^d$$. (There's a typo in
the paper, $$c$$ is a function from $$\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$$, not
$$\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$$). This can certainly be represented by a depth-2
ReLU network. To be clear on [the naming convention][7], "depth-2" does not
count the input layer, so our network should only have one ReLU layer in it as
the output shouldn't have ReLUs applied to it.

Here's how to think of the network representing $$c$$. First, assume that we
have a *minibatch* of $$n$$ elements, so that $$X$$ is the $$n\times d$$ data 
matrix. The depth-2 network representing $$c$$ can be expressed as:

$$
c(X) = 
\max\left(
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\texttt{---} & x_1 & \texttt{---} \\
\vdots  & \vdots & \vdots  \\
\texttt{---} & x_n & \texttt{---} \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{n\times d}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\mid &        & \mid \\
a      & \cdots & a \\
\mid &        & \mid
\end{bmatrix}}_{d \times n}
-
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 & \cdots & b_n
\end{bmatrix}}_{1\times n}
, \;\;
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \cdots & 0
\end{bmatrix}}_{1\times n}
\right)
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
w_1 \\ \vdots \\ w_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $$b$$ and the zero-vector used in the maximum "broadcast" as necessary in
Python code.

Given a fixed dataset $$S=\{z_1,\ldots,z_n\}$$ of distinct inputs with labels
$$y_1,\ldots,y_n$$, we must be able to find settings of $$a,w,$$ and $$b$$ such
that $$c(z_i)=y_i$$ for all $$i$$. You might be guessing how we're doing this:
we must reduce this to the interleaving property in Lemma 1. Due to the
uniqueness of the $$z_i$$, it is possible to find $$a$$ to make the
$$x_i=z_i^Ta$$ terms satisfy the interleaving property. Then we have a full rank
solution, hence $$y=Aw$$ results in $$w^* = A^{-1}y$$ as our final weights,
where $$A$$ is precisely that matrix from Lemma 1! We also see that, indeed,
there are $$n+n+d$$ weights in the network.  This is an interesting and fun
proof, and I think variants of this question would work well as a homework
assignment for a Deep Learning class.

The authors conclude the paper by trying to understand generalization with
*linear* models, in the hope that some of the intuition will transfer over to
the Deep Learning setting. With linear models, given some weights $$w$$
resulting from the optimization problem, what can we say about generalization
just by looking at it? Curvature is one popular metric to understand the
*quality* of the minima (which is not necessarily the same as the generalization
criteria!), but the Hessian is independent of $$w$$, so in fact it seems
impossible to use curvature for generalization. I'm convinced this is true for
the normal mean square loss, but is this still true if the loss function were,
say, the *cube* of the $$L_2$$ difference? After all, there are only two
derivatives applied on $$w$$, right?

The authors instead urge us to think of stochastic gradient descent instead of
curvature when trying to measure quality. Assuming that $$w_0=0$$, the
stochastic gradient descent update consists of a series of "linear combination"
updates, and hence the result is just a linear combination *of* linear
combinations *of* linear combinations ... (and so forth) ... which at the end of
the day, remains a linear combination. (I don't think they need to assume
$$w_0=0$$ if we can add an extra 1 to all the data points.) Consequently, they
can fit any set of labels of the data by solving a linear equation, and indeed,
they get strong performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10, even *without*
regularization.

They next try to relate this to a minimum norm interpretation, though this is
not a fruitful direction because their results are worse when they try to find
minimum norm solutions.  On MNIST, their best solution using some "Gabor wavelet
transform" (what?), is twice as better as the minimum norm solution. I'm not
sure how much stock to put into this section, other than how I like their
perspective of thinking of SGD as an implicit regularizer (like batch
normalization) rather than an optimizer. The line between the categories is
blurring.

To conclude, from my growing experience with Deep Learning, I don't find their
experimental results surprising. That's not to say the paper was entirely
predictable, but think of it this way: if I were a computer vision researcher
pre-AlexNet, I  would be *more* surprised at reading the AlexNet paper as I am
today reading this paper. Ultimately, as I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed this
paper, and while it was predictable (that word again...) that it couldn't offer
any *solutions*, perhaps it will be useful as a starting point to understanding
generalization in Deep Learning.
