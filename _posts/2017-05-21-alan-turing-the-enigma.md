I finished reading Andrew Hodges' book *Alan Turing: The Engima*, otherwise
known as the definitive biography of mathematician, computer scientist, and code
breaker Alan Turing. I was inspired to read the book in part because I've been
reading lots of AI-related books this year[^reading_list] and in just about
every one of those books, Alan Turing is mention in some form. In addition, I
saw the film *The Imitation Game*, and indeed this is the book that inspired it.
I bought the 2014 edition of the book --- with *The Imitation Game* cover ---
during a recent visit to the [National Cryptology Museum][2].

The author is Andrew Hodges, who at that time was a mathematics instructor at
the University of Oxford (he's now retired). He maintains a website where he
commemorates Alan Turing's life and achievements. I encourage the interested
reader to [check it out][1]. Hodges has the qualifications to write about the
book, being deeply versed in mathematics. He also appears to be gay
himself.[^just_saying]

After reading the book, my immediate thoughts relating to the *positive* aspects
of the books are:

- The book is organized chronologically and the eight chapters are indicated
  with date ranges. Thus, for a biography of this size, it is relatively
  straightforward to piece together a mental timeline of Alan Turing's life.

- The book is *detailed*. Like, *wow*. The edition I have is 680 pages, not
  counting the endnotes at the back of the book which command an extra 30 or so
  pages. Since I read almost every word of this book (I skipped a few endnotes),
  and because I tried to stay alert when reading this book, I felt like I got a
  clear picture of Turing's life, along with what life must have been like
  during the World War II-era.
  
- The book contains quotes and writings from Turing that show just how far ahead
  of his time he was. For instance, even today people are still utilizing
  concepts from his famous 1936 paper *On Computable Numbers, with an
  Application to the Entscheidungsproblem* and his 1950 paper *Computing
  Machinery and Intelligence*. The former introduced Turing Machines, the latter
  introduced the famous [Turing Test][4]. Fortunately, I don't think there was
  much exaggeration of Turing's accomplishments, unlike the *The Imitation
  Game*. When I was reading his quotes, I often had to remind myself that "this
  is the 1940s or 1950s ...."

- The book showcases the struggles of being gay, particularly during a time when
  homosexual activity was a crime. The book actually doesn't seem to cover some
  of his struggles in the early 1950s as much as I thought it would be, but it
  was probably difficult to find sufficient references for this aspect of his
  life. At the very least, readers today should appreciate how much our attitude
  towards homosexuality has improved.

That's not to say there weren't a few downsides. Here are some I thought of:

- Related to what I mentioned earlier, it is *long*. It too me a month to
  finish, and the writing is in "1983-style" which makes it more difficult for
  me to understand. (By contrast, I read *both* of Richard Dawkins' recent
  autobiographies, which combine to be roughly the same length as Hodges' book,
  and Dawkins' books were much easier to read.) Now, I find Turing's life very
  interesting so this is more of a "neutral" factor to me, but I can see why the
  casual reader might be dissuaded from reading this book.

- Much of the material is technical even to me. I understand the basics of
  Turing Machines but certainly not how the early computers were built. The
  hardest parts of the book to read are probably in chapters six and seven (out
  of eight total). I kept asking to myself "what's a cathode ray"?

To conclude, the book is an extremely detailed overview of Turing's life which
at times may be technically challenging to read.

I wonder what Alan Turing would think about AI today. The widely-used AI
undergraduate textbook by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig concludes with the
follow prescient quote by Turing:

> We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs
> to be done.

Earlier scientists have an advantage in setting their legacy in their fields
since it's easier to make landmark contributions. I view Charles Darwin, for
instance, as the greatest biologist who has ever lived, and no matter how
skilled today's biologists are, I believe none will ever be able to surpass
Darwin's impact. The same goes today for Alan Turing, who (possibly along with
John von Neumann) is one of the two preeminent computer scientists who has ever
lived. 

Despite all the talent that's out there in computer science, I don't think any
one individual can possibly surpass Turing's legacy on computer science and
artificial intelligence.

[^reading_list]: Thus, the 2017 edition of my reading list post ([here's the
    2016 version, if you're wondering][3]) is going to be *very* biased in terms
    of AI. Stay tuned!

[^just_saying]: I only say this because people who are members of "certain
    groups" --- where membership criteria is not due to choice but due to
    intrinsic human characteristics --- tend to have more knowledge about the
    group than "outsiders." Thus, a gay person by default has extra credibility
    when writing about being gay than would a straight person. A deaf person by
    default has extra credibility when writing about deafness than a hearing
    person. And so on.
