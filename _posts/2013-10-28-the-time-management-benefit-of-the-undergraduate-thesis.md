As someone who is currently working on a computer science thesis this year, one of the things that&#8217;s really hit home lately is how the undergraduate thesis serves as a healthy &#8220;medium&#8221; between the undergraduate student and the beginning graduate student mentalities.

For one&#8217;s first few years as an undergraduate, it is expected that he or she focus primarily on courses. Research is an excellent &#8220;extracurricular&#8221; activity and should be taken seriously, but unless one does an extraordinary job &#8212; by that, I mean first-rate conference or journal publications &#8212; it is likely that students still need to perform well in courses in order to get accepted into a Ph.D. program.

Meanwhile, the beginning graduate student at a Ph.D. program suddenly needs to [*break away from the undergraduate mentality*][1] in order to succeed.

I&#8217;m at the point where my grades are still important, but my research is starting to become a bigger part of my studies. Consequently, I have to find sufficient time away from my &#8220;normal&#8221; classes to focus on research. It&#8217;s tempting to let thesis work slide in favor of another hour or two spent on perfecting a problem set to get that &#8220;A&#8221; grade, but it can add up. As a time-management technique, I suggest having a schedule for one&#8217;s thesis work outlined in a &#8220;problem set&#8221; format so that it mirrors what a typical science class would be like.

PS: Yes, I know I haven&#8217;t been blogging too much lately. I&#8217;m sorry.
