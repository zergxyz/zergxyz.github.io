In the process of applying to graduate school, and then visiting schools that
admitted me, I was told that PhD students needed to possess solid writing
ability in addition to technical skills. One UT Austin professor told me he
believed liberal arts students (like me) were better prepared than those from
large research universities, presumably because of our increased exposure to
writing courses. One Cornell professor emphasized the importance of writing by
telling me that he spent at least 50 percent of his professional life writing.
A Berkeley professor who I frequently collaborate with has a private Google Doc
that he gives to students with instructions on writing papers, particularly
about how to structure an introduction, what phrases to use, and so on.

The ability to write well is an important skill for academics, and I don't mean
to dismiss this outright. However, I think that we need to be very clear that
technical skills matter *far, far more* for the typical graduate student, at
least for computer science students focusing in artificial intelligence like me.
I would additionally argue that factors such as research advisors and graduate
student collaborators matter more than writing ability.

Perhaps the emphasis on writing skills is aimed at two groups of people:
international students, and the very best graduate students for whom technical
skills are relatively less of a research bottleneck. I won't comment too much on
the former group, besides saying that I absolutely respect their commitment to
learning the English language and that I know I'm incredibly lucky to be a
native English user.

I bring up the second group because much of the advice I get are from faculty at
top institutions who were stellar graduate students. Perhaps most of their
academic life is dominated by the time it takes to convert research
contributions to a paper, instead of the time it takes to *actually come up with
the contribution itself*. For instance, this is what UT Austin professor Scott
Aaronson had to say in an [old 2005 (!!) blog post][1], back when he was a
postdoc (emphasis mine):

Two months of writing for every week of research? I have no idea how that is
humanly possible.

For me, the *reverse* holds: I probably spend two months of *research* for every
week of actual writing. What dominates my academic life is the time it takes (a)
to process the details from academic papers so that I understand how their ideas
work, and (b) to build upon those results with my own novel contribution.
Getting intuition on novel artificial intelligence concepts takes a considerable
amount of mathematical thinking, and getting them to work in practice requires
programming skills. Both math and programming fall under the realm of "technical
skills."

Obviously, once I HAVE a research contribution, *then* I have to "worry" about
writing it, but I enjoy writing so it is no big deal. 

But again, *the research contribution itself must first exist*. That's what
frustrates me about much of the academic advice that I see. Yes, it's easier to
tell someone how to write (use this phrase, don't use this phrase, active
instead of passive, blah blah blah), but it would be better to explain the
thought process on how to come up with an original research contribution.

I conclude:

> I would happily trade away some of my writing ability for a commensurate
> increase in technical skill.

Again, I am not disregard writing ability, since it is incredibly valuable for
many reasons (such as for blogging!!) and more applicable than technical skills
in life. However, I believe that the biggest priority for computer science
doctoral students should be to focus on technical skills.
