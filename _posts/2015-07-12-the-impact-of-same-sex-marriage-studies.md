In a continuation of [my post regarding the same sex marriage
ruling](http://danieltakeshi.github.io/thoughts-on-the-same-sex-marriage-ruling), I've been thinking
about the potential impact of long-term same sex marriage studies. The kind I'm thinking of would be
those that analyze the childhood and adult lives of people raised by two legally married adults of
the same sex.  While most people opposing same sex marriage do so on religious grounds, a
substantial fraction instead argue that every child earns a mom and a dad. To strengthen that
argument, these people could turn to long-term studies showing that children raised by two moms or
two dads are "worse off" than children raised in traditional families. To precisely define "worse
off," we can look at factors such as overall happiness, overall health, future income, or a mix of
these.

It is admirable to use research studies to back up one's point (politicians, pay attention!), but
with regards to the ones I'm thinking about now, I don't believe such studies even exist. The issue
of same sex marriage has only recently been at the forefront of public debate, so any long-term
study would really be a short-term study.  Second, we also have to consider that gay adults who
marry an opposite-sex adult (perhaps under pressure) would likely not feel the same kind of
affection as is common in parents of traditional families. I can't imagine that a child could feel
comfortable if his or her parents do not feel true affection towards each other.

Throwing those scenarios out the window, suppose we did have studies that showed negative impacts of
same sex adults on their children. Even then, I'm not sure this should be a reason to invalidate
same sex marriage. Here's why: we get in a slippery slope of what we should allow for marriage.
Without even doing any research, I can probably tell that children raised by parents who
collectively earn $40,000 a year will be worse off than those raised by parents who earn $400,000 a
year.  Likewise, I can also probably find studies showing that children born to two black parents
(of opposite sex) will be worse off than children born to two white parents (of opposite sex), even
if income levels are the same. Then we would  have to raise uncomfortable questions, such as whether
    we should have an income cutoff level for marriage. I'm not sure this is desirable, hence why
    even if studies show that it's better for a child to be born in a traditional family, that's not
    something we should use to prohibit same sex marriage.
