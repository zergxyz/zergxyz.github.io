Hello world!

Well, I guess that&#8217;s good enough for an introduction. No, wait, this isn&#8217;t a world of
computer science, so I guess it&#8217;s not good enough. (Computer science people will understand
the joke.) Actually, I have to retract the last statement &#8212; isn&#8217;t it already a world of
computers? Anyway, I&#8217;m an eighteen year old male living in the United States. I&#8217;m a
student at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and my hometown is Guilderland, New
York. I have also been deaf since birth.

I have two primary objectives in mind about this blog. The first is that I want to spread my
knowledge of deafness and deaf culture to my readers. The second is that I also want to talk about
what life is like as a college student, as well as in academia. I hope to land a job in academia
within the next decade. By doing so, I&#8217;ll be one of the few deaf people I know who have an
academic job. I know that there are numerous deaf professors at the National Technical Institute for
the Deaf at RIT &#8211; maybe even fifty or so &#8211; but elsewhere, professors are scarce. It is
my lifelong aim to rectify that.

And, naturally, there will also be some random posts about things just popping up in my head, or
just random things because I want to write something down for the sake of writing something down. Or
perhaps they&#8217;ll be something so important that I just can&#8217;t ignore them. What about the
House just passing a deal to avoid a debt crisis on August 2nd? (Oh wait, that&#8217;s a random
thought!) I&#8217;ll just include those in an &#8220;everything else&#8221; category. But hopefully,
I&#8217;ll be able to focus mostly on academia and deafness.

More details about my aspirations, expectations, and interests will come in future posts when I get
used to the WordPress platform. **UPDATE**: As of May 13, 2015, I have migrated to Jekyll.

I look forward to having a long, lasting blog!
