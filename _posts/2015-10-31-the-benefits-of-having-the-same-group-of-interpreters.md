I just submitted a sign language interpreting services request for the spring 2016 semester, when I
am likely to take EE 227C and CS 267. The former is the third convex optimization course offered at
Berkeley, and the latter is a popular entry-level graduate course on parallel computing and systems.

For this request, though, I also said that I wanted to have a *more consistent group* of
interpreters. This means I would prefer to have the same interpreters currently working now (or
those from last semester) to be assigned to those two courses. Just like in the Spring 2015
semester, I have a standard group of three to four interpreters this semester, but strangely enough,
none of them were also part of the Spring 2015 group.  This is despite how all of the interpreters
are assigned out of the same Bay Area company, [Partners In Communication
LLC](http://partnersincommunicationllc.com/).

In addition, there's been another interpreting issue for this semester in particular. I'm not sure
why, but I have had an unusual amount of substitutes.  There are two primary interpreters, plus one
primary substitute interpreter, but then there have been at least *five* cases (as far as I can
remember, all involving different people) when I've had *substitutes for substitutes*.

This would be frustrating even if I was taking an undergraduate humanities course, but when the
material is so technical in my courses, a normal person cannot convey the material clearly on day
one. At least with consistent interpreters, they can pick up some of the common terminology.  The
people who interpret for my Convex Optimization class (EE 227BT) have gotten so used to hearing the
words "positive semidefinite matrix" together that they can now understand that sequence when it's
used in other classes. (Positive semidefinite matrices are *everywhere* in machine learning -- I
can't believe I went through undergrad without knowing about them, and now I'm one of their biggest
fans.)

Consistent interpreting is something that I admittedly did not think about when requesting for
services last semester, but I will remember this for the future. It is already [challenging
for interpreters to work in STEM
courses](http://danieltakeshi.github.io/2012/02/04/technical-term-dilemma/), so there needs to be
consistency so that they improve throughout a semester. Note that in general, I *do* benefit
somewhat from interpreting services despite issues in STEM courses, and in some cases interpreters
are essential (as was the case a few weeks ago when an ear infection meant I had to stop wearing my
right hearing aid for a week), so this is pretty important to me.

Oh, speaking of interpreting requests, I also need to hope that no one else ["strongly suggests" me
to drop and/or add a
course](http://danieltakeshi.github.io/2015/04/25/why-its-difficult-for-me-to-drop-classes/) at the
last minute, though admittedly, *adding* a course results in substantially fewer headaches as
compared to *dropping* a course.
