My birthday&#8217;s on August 10. I was born on August 10, 1992. It&#8217;s not August 10th yet, at
least in my current timezone, but I was born in a different timezone that&#8217;s 3 hours later. So
I still consider myself 19. Only two more years until I can drink legally!

This got me wondering. If someone is born in L.A. and immediately moves to New York city to live, is
that person automatically 3 more hours older, excluding the transportation time?

**UPDATE** June 24, 2013: I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s taken me this long to realize that I originally
mistyped the title of this post. It used to be &#8220;So, I turned 19,&#8221; without the
capitalized &#8220;t&#8221; &#8230;

**UPDATE** May 13, 2015: To answer my original question, your true age is based on the time zone
when you were actually born.
