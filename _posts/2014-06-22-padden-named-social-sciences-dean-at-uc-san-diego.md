In deaf-related news, I just found that [Carol Padden][1], professor of communication at the University of California, San Diego, has been [named dean of the social sciences][2] at her school. Her tenure will start in October.

I didn&#8217;t know her before this announcement, so it was interesting to read about her background. She was born as the second deaf child of two deaf faculty members at Gallaudet University. She started her education in a deaf school and then became a mainstreamed student at a public school system.

After graduating from Georgetown in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science in Linguistics, she went to UC San Diego to pursue a PhD in Linguistics, which she obtained in 1983. She has since been on the faculty (and, of course, will be a dean) at the same school, specializing in the study of American Sign Language. Professor Padden seems particularly interested about understanding the variety of sign languages that are developing throughout the world. For instance, what properties of sign languages develop after only one or two generations of use? Which ones require more time to evolve? While I can&#8217;t judge her research, it must be top-tier, since she was a [MacArthur Fellow][3] in 2010.
