One of the things that I've been a little frustrated about lately is the time it takes to arrange
and obtain academic accommodations, such as sign language interpreting or captioning services. I
can't just show up to a lecture or an event and expect a sign language interpreter to be there. I
have to explicitly request the service, and there are many reasons why this process might get
delayed.

- Before agencies or institutions provide the service, I have to *prove* that I need the service.
  This means, at minimum, I need to provide them my audiogram, and they might need some additional
  background information about my education. Sometimes an interview is required; I had a remote
  interview with a Berkeley DSP employee before I had arrived for my first classes.

- After the initial registration hurdle, I can start formally requesting accommodations. To schedule
  an accommodation for a campus-related event, I have to fill out an online form with information
  about the time, the location, and other stuff. Berkeley's gotten better with the forms, as they've
  implemented extra features [that help to counter my earlier criticism][4]. On the other hand,
  there can still be a noticeable delay between when I submit the form and when I get responses, and
  I have to keep reminding myself that weekends and vacations do not count as "real days" when
  counting how many days in advance to submit a request.

- In some cases, it can be extremely annoying to schedule accommodations for one-time events. If it
  is the first time that I am participating in an event, then I usually don't have much information
  on the setting or environment, and it is not always clear if there will be one speaker (which is
  easier for an interpreter) or a debate with people shouting simultaneously. In addition, I often
  need to have a detailed schedule of the event, and it's common to have people wait until the last
  minute to finalize schedules. I've had to send lots of emails to remind others that I need a
  detailed schedule ASAP, and people hate to see "ASAP."

- Finally, it's not clear how much accommodations can help in practice. I'm not counting cases when
  there's some kind of mistake in the scheduling (they do happen sometimes, [as in my prelims][2]).
  I'm considering cases when they work normally, but they simply do not produce any benefit. For
  instance, [when I took CS 288][3], I had captioning services. In general, they *worked as
  intended* (well, not always) but it was extremely hard for me to follow and understand concepts
  based on real-time, imperfect captions.

I should note, of course, that I'm not the only one who has mentioned this. In fact, I was actually
inspired to write this short piece after [reading a longer essay by Teresa Blankmeyer Burke][1], an
Associate Professor of Philosophy at Gallaudet University who is deaf. Her blog post covers on some
of the themes regarding the time it takes to schedule accommodations. I think her experience is
similar to mine: lots and lots of emails to write and forms to fill.

Nonetheless, despite the annoyance of scheduling accommodations, it is important for me to look at
the big picture. First, I usually *get* the accommodations, which is something that not every deaf
person in the world can say. In addition, even when accommodations do not work that well, I know
that the people providing them are trying their best to help me, and I appreciate that.
