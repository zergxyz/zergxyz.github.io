On November 18, 2016, there was a fantastic essay in the New York Times by Mark
Lilla of Columbia University called "[The End of Identity Liberalism][1]". This
essay will go down in history as one that I will remember for a long time.

I have long wanted to write something about identity politics, but I could never
find the time to research and eloquently describe my beliefs on such a sensitive
topic, so a concise reaction to Lilla's essay will have to do for now.

Despite being a registered Democrat, one area where I seem to disagree with
liberals --- at least if we can infer anything from the 2016 election, which
admittedly is asking for a lot --- is over the issue of identity politics.  I
personally feel uncomfortable at best about the practice of identity politics.
I also believe that, while identity politics obviously has well-meaning
*intentions*, it accelerates the development of undesirable side effects.

Exhibit A: the election of Donald Trump (well, undesirable to most liberals).

When I was reading Lilla's essay, the following passage hit home to me:

> [Hillary Clinton] tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and
> slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to
> African-American, Latino, L.G.B.T. and women voters at every stop. This was a
> strategic mistake. If you are going to mention groups in America, you had
> better mention all of them. If you don't, those left out will notice and feel
> excluded. Which, as the data show, was exactly what happened with the white
> working class and those with strong religious convictions. Fully two-thirds of
> white voters without college degrees voted for Donald Trump, as did over 80
> percent of white evangelicals.

While it is true that, if I had to pick any race to associate with the
"privileged" label, white Americans would be the easy choice. However, [as
suggested by Joe Biden][3], it is difficult for the white working class to
associate themselves with privilege and with identity liberalism.

Aside from the working class whites, another group of people in America who I
believe "lack privilege" are people with disabilities.  I also think that this
group fails to get sufficient recognition compared to other groups (relative to
population size). That is not to say that the group is *ignored*, but with
limited time and money, political parties have to selectively choose what to
promote and champion. Clinton talked about supporting disabled people in her
campaign, but this was probably more motivated from Trump's actions than a
Democrat-led initiative to treat disabled people as a political group with
higher priority than others.  (Again, it's not about being *in favor of* or
*against of*, but about *the priority level*.)

After thinking about it, even though I might benefit from increased "identity
politics" towards people with disabilities, I *still* would probably feel
uncomfortable taking part or engaging in the practice, given that any such focus
on a group of people necessarily leaves out others.

A second reason why I would feel uncomfortable is that within voting blocks, we
are seeing increased diversity.  According to exit polls of the 2016 election.
Trump [*actually made gains* among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, *and*
Asian Americans compared to Mitt Romney][2]! Sometimes I worry that the focus on
labeling groups of people has the effect that Lilla observes later:

> The surprisingly high percentage of the Latino vote that went to Mr. Trump
> should remind us that the longer ethnic groups are here in this country, the
> more politically diverse they become.

I wouldn't want my beliefs pigeonholed just because of who I am.  (Sadly, I have
experienced several frustrating examples of this within the deaf community.)

Overall, I prefer the approach where policies are designed to bring *everyone*
up together, *so long as* they are given *an equal starting ground*.  I know
that this is sadly not true in America yet. Therefore, if I *had* to support any
form of identity politics, it would be one which focuses chiefly on improving
the lives of children from low-income families within the first 5-10 years of
life under the critical junction of education and nutrition.

I am under no illusions that part of why I did well in school is that I didn't
grow up in poverty. And indeed, being 50% Asian and 50% Caucasian might have
helped (though Asians are often not treated as minority groups, and mixed-race
people are often ignored in polls about race, but those are subjects for another
day).

Ultimately, identity politics is probably not going to make or break my life
goals at this point. My impetus in raising this discussion,  however, is largely
about my concern over the future of many students and old friends that I know
from high school. Some come from low-income families and face challenges in
their lives which are not prioritized by the current identity liberalism. For
instance, I was shocked to learn this year when someone I knew from high school
was recently arrested for *attempted murder*. I still have access to his
Facebook page, and it's heartbreaking to read. His wife posts pictures of him
and his child and keeps asking him to "hang in there" until he can return to the
family.

This guy is younger than me and his future already seems dashed. His biggest
challenge in life is probably that he shares my disability, so I worry that
people similar to him will never be able to escape out of their cycle of
poverty. I hope that there is a way that we can move towards an identity-free
future without the risk of alienating people like him, and also of course, with
the effect of increasing the economic possibilities and fairness for all of us.
