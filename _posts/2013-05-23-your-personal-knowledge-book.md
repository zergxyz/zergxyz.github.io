I&#8217;ve just completed my sixth semester at Williams College, and I feel an urge to try and store
the material I&#8217;ve learned from my computer science and math courses. I want to do this
primarily because (a) I know I&#8217;ll be incorporating concepts from previous courses into my
future research, and (b) I want to minimize the amount of class material I forget.

Yes, I know as well as anyone that this won&#8217;t prevent me from forgetting most of what I learn.
But I&#8217;m trying to find ways to avoid this as much as possible. Professor Calvin Newport
suggests keeping a [knowledge vault][1] for this purpose. I&#8217;m doing something slightly
different than what he recommends.

I&#8217;m going to try writing a personalÂ book where each chapter corresponds to one of my college
classes. (I may later generalize this so that some chapters pertain to other topics, such as nifty
Unix tricks.) Part of the current table of contents is shown below.

You can see that I basically have the table of contents, and almost nothing else. I&#8217;ve only
been able to fill in one chapter in depth &#8212; the graph theory one, which isn&#8217;t shown in
the contents in the previous image since I put the math courses after the computer science courses.
You can also see that LaTeX essentially includes &#8220;hyperlinks&#8221; in the final PDF output,
so if I click on a chapter, I immediate arrive at the corresponding page.

As an interesting side note, I included a nice picture of the Hoffman-Singleton graph in that graph
theory chapter.

In case you&#8217;re wondering, I included this because one of my notorious graph theory midterm
questions concerned the upper bound on vertex count in relation to degree and diameter. I was
supposed to find two examples of [Moore graphs][4] aside from the complete graphs and odd cycles.
The Petersen graph was easy enough to obtain, but expecting us to obtain the Hoffman-Singleton graph
was just absurd. Fortunately, the professor fully expected no student to answer this question
perfectly, which is exactly what happened.

Anyway, it will be interesting to see how my personal book progresses. I usually fail to keep
long-term projects running, but I&#8217;ll try. After all, if I can maintain a blog for almost two
years running, then my knowledge book has potential. Feel free to comment if you have your own ways
of constructing a knowledge vault.
