[There's an opinion piece in the New York Times][1] by Moises Velasquez-Manoff
which talks about (drum roll please) biracial people. As he mentions:

> Multiracials make up an estimated 7 percent of Americans, according to the Pew
> Research Center, and theyâ€™re predicted to grow to 20 percent by 2050.

Thus, I suspect that sometime in the next few decades, we will start talking
about race in terms of precise racial percentages, such as "100 percent White"
or in rarer cases, "25 percent White, 25 percent Asian, 25 percent Black, and 25
percent Native American." (Incidentally, I'm not sure why the article uses
"Biracial" when "Multiracial" would clearly have been a more appropriate term;
it was likely due to the Barack Obama factor.) 

The phrase "precise racial percentages" is misleading. Since all humans came
from the same ancestor, at some point in history we must have been "one race."
For the sake of defining these racial percentages, we can take a date --- say
4000BC --- when, presumably, the various races were sufficiently different,
ensconced in their respective geographic regions, and when interracial marriages
(or rape) was at a minimum. All humans alive at that point thus get a "100
percent [insert_race_here]" attached to them, and we do the arithmetic from
there.

What usually happens in practice, though, is that we often default to describing
one part of one race, particularly with people who are $$X$$ percent Black,
where $$X > 0$$. This is a relic of the embarrassing "One Drop Rule" the United
States had, but for now it's probably --- well, I hope --- more for
self-selecting racial identity.

Listing precise racial percentages would help us better identify people who are
not easy to immediately peg in racial categories, which will increasingly become
an issue as more and more multiracial people like me blur the lines between the
races.  In fact, this is already a problem for me even with single-race people:
I sometimes cannot distinguish between Hispanics versus Whites. For instance, I
thought Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were 100 percent White.

Understanding race is also important when considering racial diversity and
various ethical or sensitive questions over who should get "preferences." For
instance, I wonder if people label me as a "privileged white male" or if I get a
pass for being biracial?  Another question: for a job at a firm which has had a
history of racial discrimination and is trying to make up for that, should the
applicant who is 75 percent Black, 25 percent White, get a hair's preference
versus someone who is 25 percent Black and 75 percent White?  Would this also
apply if they actually have very similar skin color?

In other words, does one weigh more towards the looks or the precise
percentages?  I think the precise percentages method is the way schools,
businesses, and government operate, despite how this isn't the case in casual
conversations.

Anyway, these are some of the thoughts that I have as we move towards a more
racially diverse society, as multiracial people cannot have single-race children
outside of adoption.

Back to the article: as one would expect, it discusses the benefits of racial
diversity. I can agree with the following passage:

> Social scientists find that homogeneous groups like [Donald Trump's] cabinet
> can be less creative and insightful than diverse ones. They are more prone to
> groupthink and less likely to question faulty assumptions.

The caveat is that this assumes the people involved are equally qualified; a
racially homogeneous (in whatever race), but extremely well-educated cabinet
would be much better than a racially diverse cabinet where no one even finished
high school. But controlling for quality, I can agree.

Diversity also benefits individuals, as the author notes. It is here where Mr.
Velasquez-Manoff points out that Barack Obama was not just Black, but also
biracial, which may have benefited his personal development. Multiracials make
up a large fraction of the population in racially diverse Hawaii, where Obama
was born (albeit, probably with more Asian-White overlap).

Yes, I agree that diversity is important for a variety of reasons. It is not
easy, however:

> It's hard to know what to do about this except to acknowledge that diversity

> associated with diversity can be thought of as the pain of exercise," Katherine

I cannot agree more. 

Moving on:

> Closer, more meaningful contact with those of other races may help assuage the
> underlying anxiety. Some years back, Dr. Gaither of Duke ran an intriguing
> study in which incoming white college students were paired with either
> same-race or different-race roommates. After four months, roommates who lived

> interactions.

Ouch, this felt like a blindsiding attack, and is definitely my main gripe with
this article. In college, I had two roommates, both of whom have a different
racial makeup than me. They both seemed to be relatively popular and had little
difficulty mingling with a diverse group of students. Unfortunately, I certainly
did not have a "diverse group of friends." After all, if there was a prize for
college for "least popular student" I would be a perennial contender.  (As
incredible as it may sound, in high school, where things were *worse* for me, I
can remember a handful of people who might have been even *lower* on the social
hierarchy.)

Well, I guess what I want to say is that, this attack notwithstanding, Mr.
Velasquez-Manoff's article brings up interesting and reasonably accurate points
about biracial people. At the very least, he writes about concepts which are
sometimes glossed over or under-appreciated nowadays in our discussions about
race.
