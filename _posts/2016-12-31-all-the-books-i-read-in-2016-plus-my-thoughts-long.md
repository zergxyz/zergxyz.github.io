---

Last year, [I wrote a normal-length blog post][9] about my three favorite books
that I read that year. For 2016, I thought I would do something a little
different: why not list *all* the books I read this year? That way, I won't
forget what I read, and if anyone complains to me saying "why do young adults
nowadays spending time on social media instead of reading books?", I can simply
refer them to my blog.  Genius!

I have done precisely that in this lengthy post, which I've been updating
throughout the year by writing summaries of books as soon as I've finished them.
I read 38 books this year. (Textbooks, magazines, newspapers, and research
papers don't count.) The summaries here are only for the *non-fiction* books
that I read this year. I read three easy fiction books in January to get me
warmed up,[^thrillers] so the summaries here are for the other 35 books. Here's
a rough set of categories:

1. Medicine and Surgery (4 books)
2. Work Habits and Technology (4 books)
3. History and Foreign Affairs (5 books)
4. Religion (5 books)
5. Science (4 books)
6. NSA and CIA (3 books)
7. Biographies and Memoirs (3 books)
8. Miscellaneous (7 books)

Last note: books I especially liked are indicated with double asterisks by the
title, \*\* **like this** \*\*.


## Group 1: Medicine and Surgery

I read all of [Atul Gawande][1]'s four books. Gawande is a famous surgeon who
also gave the 2012 commencement speech for my alma matter. I think he's an
excellent surgeon-writer. His books contain a healthy amount of technical detail
on surgery and medicine without going overboard to discourage the lay reader
like myself. They not only give me a glimpse into what it must be like to work
in medicine, but also make me appreciate my relatively good physical health.
Some of the stories Gawande describes about his patients are absolutely
shuddering.

Here are my thoughts on his books:

- **Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science**, Gawande's first
  book and a finalist for the National Book Award, discusses the various
  complications and uncertainty that arise in surgery and medicine. It is
  divided into three parts: fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. What happens
  when doctors make mistakes? And how do people feel about an inexperienced
  surgeon working on them? (After all, everyone has to start somewhere!) What
  about when there are cases that simply elude everyone? How about pure judgment
  calls? Each of the fourteen chapters covers a certain theme, and consists of
  several related stories. It's a nice portrayal of how medicine faces some of
  the inherent difficulties in its field.

- **Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance**. Gawande explores different ways
  to get "better" at surgery and medicine. Like his last book, this one is a
  collection of loosely-related stories. In general, Gawande doesn't directly
  propose solutions to various issues, but rather, he provides examples of how
  certain people at the top of their field (e.g., those treating cystic
  fibrosis) carry out their work, in comparison to "ordinary" people. There are
  also some interesting but awkward topics: how should physicians treat the
  handling of patient genitals, and how should doctors discuss their "bell
  curve" of performance and the possibility that they may be at the lower tail?
  While the book is a nice collection of stories, the selection and ordering of
  topics might seem somewhat haphazard. Still, I felt that -- like other books
  -- it gave me a glimpse into what it is like to be a surgeon.

- \*\* **The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right** \*\* is an
  enlightening book about the power of checklists. Drawing from a variety of
  fields, including airfare, construction, and (obviously) surgery, Gawande
  shows how checklists have increased the safety and efficiency of those tasks
  that most of us take for granted. Yes, he acknowledges that checklists are
  stupidly simple. But here's the remarkable thing: why didn't anyone else write
  about this earlier? And why, as Gawande points out, do people resist utilizing
  something enormously beneficial with virtually no extra cost?  Consequently,
  I'm now thinking about where checklists might be applied to my own life. One
  qualm I had with this book, however, is that it seems to put a ton of
  statistics in terms of percentage points only (e.g., 22 percent said this ...)
  whereas we need the *raw* number to understand the significance (e.g., 22
  percent *of 10000 people* surveyed ...). This book is on the short end (fewer
  than 200 pages) so it wouldn't hurt to have a little more data and facts.

- \*\* **Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End** \*\*. What is the
  role of doctors when treating patients who are near the end of their lives?
  Surgery and medicine often restrict their focus to "fixing stuff:" if a
  patient has a problem, then doctors should undergo the procedure that will
  prolong patient's lives the most. But what if that leads to the patient going
  directly into a nursing home? What if the patient and his/her family are
  banking on being the one-percent of people who end up significantly better off
  after a specific procedure? Most examples of patient stories in *Being Mortal*
  concern cancer, a notoriously difficult disease to treat, and people are not
  always willing to undergo brutal surgery and chemotherapy. I should point out
  that this is *not* a book on assisted *suicide*; the book only dedicates about
  four pages to that topic, towards the very end. Rather, this book is about
  assisted *living*; how can we balance patient's desires while considering
  their safety and their relatives' (sometimes conflicting) desires? I liked
  this book a little more than I liked *The Checklist Manifesto*, and it made me
  think about what I would want to happen to my older relatives. And, of course,
  myself, but hopefully I won't have to worry about that for a long time.


## Group 2: Work Habits and Technology

In this group, I have two books by Georgetown computer science professor [Cal
Newport][2].  I first became aware of Professor Newport's blog back in high
school when I Google-d "how to get good grades in college." That search led me to
a College Confidential thread which subsequently linked to his blog. 

Professor Newport is a voracious reader (which I hope to be as well), so he
recommends and discusses a number of books on his blog. I chose to read two of
them.

- **So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for
  Work You Love**. Here, Newport argues that the often-cited "follow your
  passion!" suggestion is actually terrible, and people are better suited at
  *developing skills* that will allow them to eventually figure out their dream
  jobs. In short: don't quit your job now with the fantasy that you'll
  enjoy this new thing you're starting out next week -- you'll end up worse than
  you were when you started.  It is true that I *sometimes* feel like I may not
  be in an ideal job for me, but then I think things over, and realize that the
  current PhD program I'm in is clearly training me for a *lot* of jobs. Even if
  being a professor isn't in the cards for me, I'm still learning a lot about
  programming, about advanced computer science, about teaching, about making
  connections, etc. Thus, this book made me feel happy that I am spending my
  twenties in an intellectually stimulating environment where my main
  responsibility is to learn new things and blog.

- \*\* **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World** \*\*. This
  is Professor Newport's most recent book and arguably his best, which became a
  Wall Street Journal 2016 business bestseller. His hypothesis here -- which was
  obvious to me from the start -- is that *deep work*, which is a state in which
  one is able to focus very heavily on a topic, churning out lots of work in a
  short amount of time, is becoming *rarer* at a time when it's becoming *more
  valuable*.  The former is due to distractions from smart phones and social
  media, and the latter is because the knowledge economy means people can pay
  the best workers remotely rather than hire locally for less-skilled people.
  When I was reading this book to myself, I kept thinking: *come on, why on
  earth am I not engaging in deep work*? There's a lot of advice here, and
  there's no way I can integrate them all, but I've been able to take a few
  steps (e.g., as my Facebook "friends" can attest, I don't check Facebook
  frequently, and I don't have Twitter, Instragram, SnapChat, or whatever is
  popular nowadays, and I check my smart phone a lot less than most people). I
  agree with a lot of what Newport says here; it seems like so much common
  sense.  I have to add, it's also funny that this book got published at a time
  when a related *Deep* phenomenon called Deep *Learning* is hot in AI, but
  [that's a story for another day][3].

- **You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto**, recommended by Professor Newport, is a
  2010 book written by Jaron Lanier, one of the pioneers of virtual reality
  technology.  Lanier worries that our early technological achievements have
  locked us in into suboptimal paths. In addition, he argues that many areas of
  technology are dehumanizing and favor the crowd or algorithm over individual
  human voices. To me, while it's true that Wikipedia may be dehumanizing in
  some sense, things were arguably *much worse* pre-Wikipedia *from a
  "dehumanizing perspective"* (NOT a technological perspective). To take one
  example, as Robert Gordon describes in his fantastic book *The Rise and Fall
  of American Growth*[^alas], human life before the "great inventions" from
  1870-1970 was *extremely isolating*, particularly for rural families and
  farmers (and this continued to be the case in this era for many areas of the
  U.S., particularly in the Civil War-ravaged south). If a family is isolated
  from the rest of the world, that seems pretty dehumanizing to me. Overall, as
  you might tell, I have some mixed feelings about this book and do not revere
  it as much as Professor Newport, but it certainly brings up thought-provoking
  points.

- **Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of
  Prosperity** is a 2016 book by Douglas Rushkoff, which I became aware of after
  reading (guess what?) [one of Cal Newport's blog posts][18]. The author of
  this book is an American media theorist (what's that?) and this book
  provocatively argues that our economic "operating system" of capitalism is not
  the best for today's world. The latest technology boom creates value not with
  real things, but with *human data*. In addition, it encourages start-ups to
  create value for shareholders instead of "the people", and to sell immediately
  instead of generating revenue. Rushkoff heavily criticizes our obsession[^wsj]
  with economic growth mindset, arguing that further growth is limited and
  doesn't actually provide much value beyond the top 1 percent.  Instead,
  Rushkoff argues that we need to stop this growth mindset and ensure that
  business is designed to be peer-to-peer (as in, more like eBay, not Amazon!)
  and to re-introduce humans into the equation. This is not meant to be income
  *redistribution*; it's meant to ensure that business can work more towards an
  equal distribution of wealth. He heavily criticizes Amazon, Uber, WalMart, and
  other companies whose goal is to *destroy* competition rather than to create
  value. From reading this book, I definitely became concerned about whether I'm
  exacerbating the issue by supporting Silicon Valley ideals (I use Uber, and
  Amazon ...) and am ignoring the realities of how most people live. This book
  is something that I will try to remember and to extract policy solutions from.
  I get the feeling that many pro-business Republicans may be skeptical of his
  proposals. Even though they're technically centrist, it may *sound* more like
  liberal/socialism policies, but I would urge readers to consider this book.


## Group 3: History and Foreign Affairs

Another way for me to describe this category would be "Thomas Friedman and
Michael Mandelbaum books" since all of the books in this category are written by
them (in fact, one is co-authored by them!). For better or worse, most readers
probably know Thomas Friedman from his columns at the New York Times.  [Michael
Mandelbaum][19] is professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University, specializing
in international affairs. I enjoyed these books.

- \*\* **From Beirut to Jerusalem** \*\* is a fascinating book about Thomas
  Friedman's journey through the Middle East from 1979 to 1989, when he worked
  as a reporter and got to witness firsthand the people of Lebanon and Israel.
  The first half the book discuss his experience living in Beirut (in Lebanon).
  The second half of the book focuses on his life in Jerusalem, a religiously
  important city for Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The city was (and still is)
  hotly contested by Israelis and Palestinians. Throughout the book, Friedman
  discusses some history about how the Middle Eastern countries developed and
  why they are in constant conflict, but he also takes his reporting ability
  into account by describing detailed conversations and events he has witnessed.
  His extensive dialogue, his seemingly random thoughts about life, and his
  colorful analogies serve as intuition for what it must be like to live there.
  (In other words, I view this book as a textbook in how it teaches the reader
  about the Middle East, but the "teaching" is not through textbook-style
  language.) I do not know much about the Middle East, and even after reading
  this book, I still feel that way. But I sure think this book gave me a jump
  start in forming a baseline set of knowledge that I can draw upon when reading
  more books about the Middle East (and yes, there will be more!). The book,
  though old with its 1989 publication date, is still relevant today as the
  [Israeli-Palestinian conflict][8] proceeds without any end in sight.  The
  focus on the Middle East nowadays has probably shifted from Lebanon to
  countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran (due to terrorism and oil) and Syria
  (due to the refugee crisis and Assad) but Israel is still a major player for
  US diplomacy and foreign policy, and reading this book will be helpful in the
  process of better understanding the parties involved in the Middle East.

- \*\* **The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century** \*\*
  is a long book by Thomas Friedman. I read the third edition, published in
  2007; the first two were published in 2005 and 2006. The metaphor "the world
  is flat" refers to the forces of globalization that have connected various
  people and countries together, and which empower the individual, particularly
  the Internet and how it allows people to have their own voices with blogs.
  (Contrast this, by the way, with Jaron Lanier's book above, who argues that
  the Internet has been a chief cause of *de-empowering* the individual.) To his
  credit, Friedman emphasizes that globalization has tradeoffs. A frequent theme
  is the offshoring of work; companies can improve profits by utilizing cheaper
  labor in China and India, which benefits American consumers but makes life
  harder on those former American workers.  Globalization has impacts on
  politics, of course, because it heightens income inequality.  Friedman is
  pro-free trade, but understands that we have to provide the education and
  opportunity for people to flourish in this world.  Right now, he argues
  America is not doing anywhere near as well as it should be doing --- a quiet
  education crisis. This book is definitely a good history lesson for me, and it
  completely changed my perspective on how the world works.

- **The Frugal Superpower: America's Global Leadership in a Cash-Strapped Era**
  is a short book written in 2010 by Michael Mandelbaum. Its central argument is
  that in the twentieth century, America effectively served as the world's
  government and was able to intervene in other countries because it had the
  money to do so. But after the 2008 financial crisis, a shift emerged in U.S.
  policy: no longer can we lavishly spend money and intervene almost at will.
  Mandelbaum, while recognizing that it is not optimal to have financial crises,
  hopes that we can be more circumspect (hence, a "frugal" superpower). We will,
  however, have problems because of entitlement spending, which naturally
  implies spending less on military action. Demography is also working against
  us, but the saving grace is that the three areas of contention (Russia, China,
  and the Middle East) all have their own problems. For example, China has even
  more of a demographic problem due to their former one-child policy. Mandelbaum
  concludes that one way we can restore the world order is by taxing gasoline,
  so (a) we reduce profits of Middle Eastern countries (and indirectly, I might
  add, radical Islam), (b) provide more money to the federal government for
  entitlements, and (c) we encourage renewable and cleaner energy, thus helping
  to combat climate change. This book, with the exception of the suggestion that
  we tax gasoline, is largely subsumed by Mandelbaum's later book, *Mission Failure*.

- \*\* **That Used to Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented
  and How We Can Come Back** \*\*, co-authored by columnist Thomas Friedman and
  foreign policy professor Michael Mandelbaum, is a book arguing that America is
  failing to meet the four major challenges of today's world: globalization, the
  IT revolution, chronic deficits, and increasing energy consumption. The
  authors look at America's history and see many examples of how we have been
  able to overcome similar challenges. Unfortunately, they worry, "that used to
  be us." Today, with our political gridlock, lack of education funding, and
  competition worldwide from Asia, especially from China (who they *almost* view
  as being the most powerful country in the 21st century), it is uncertain
  whether we will be able to resolve these problems before the market or Mother
  Nature brutally forces changes down our throats.  One of their main solutions?
  A third-party presidential candidate on the "radical center" who, while not
  necessarily *winning* the election, would sufficiently influence the two
  parties to focus on the "radical center" issues, as H. Ross Perot did in the
  1992 election about balancing the deficit.  I really liked this book, and I
  agree with Bill Gates' assessment that the one word review of this book is:
  "fascinating." Not everyone would like this, however: [the Wall Street Journal
  published a negative review][7], taking a traditionally Conservative stance by
  criticizing the authors for proposing more government as the solution to
  fixing America. But then I would like to ask them: what is their proposal to
  combat climate change?

- \*\* **Mission Failure: America and the World in the Post-Cold War Era** \*\*
  is Michael Mandelbaum's fifteenth and most recent book, published in 2016 and
  dubbed by Thomas Friedman as "[a book that Barack Obama and Donald Trump would
  both enjoy][20]".  The focus is on the period starting from 1991 --- the Cold
  War's end --- to 2015.  In this period, spanning four American presidents
  (George H.W. Bush through Barack Obama), Mandelbaum argues that we spent this
  time, intentionally and unintentionally, engaging in "regime change" in other
  countries. The goal?  To convert them to Western-style countries supporting
  peace, democracies, and free markets. Those three features are the foundations
  of Mandelbaum's 2002 book *The Ideas that Conquered the World*, one of my
  favorite books and [one which I blogged about last year][9]. As examples, the
  Clinton administration engaged in substantial humanitarian intervention in
  countries that had little significance to the U.S., such as Haiti, Somalia,
  Bosnia, and Kosovo. The Bush 43 administration also engaged in nation building
  in Iraq and Afghanistan, though this was not the original goal as in both
  cases, it started from war. In addition, for many years we have tried to
  convert Russia, China, and other middle eastern countries (especially Iran and
  the Palestines) to be more like ourselves. But these missions all failed. Why?
  Probably the biggest reason is culture; in many countries, there is already so
  much sectarian violence that unity based on abstract concepts like the "rule
  of law" is not possible. In other cases, there is American resentment, as in
  Russia due to NATO expansion. I found the history behind all this to be
  fascinating.  Of course, I am also concerned.  After all, this "era" of
  American foreign policy abruptly ended by 2015, because Russia and China have
  now become powerful enough to upset the stability of global order.


## Group 4: Religion

Here are some religion-related books. Specifically, these are from the
non-religious or atheist perspective, which one might be able to tell given Sam
Harris' frequent appearance here. Don't worry, I'm going to explore with more
pro-religion books next year, and my parents have several book candidates which
I can read.

- **Moral Minority: Our Skeptical Founding Fathers**, by Brooke Allen, argues
  that the six men who she considers to be the founding fathers of America:
  Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James
  Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, were not devout Christians as many claim, but
  instead highly skeptical men influenced not by religion, but by John Locke and
  Enlightenment thoughts. By doing so, Allen further claims that due to the
  efforts of these men, the United States was *not* founded on Christian
  principles. (To me, I find it odd that we're often considered a "Christian
  nation" when the First Amendment *explicitly* allows for Freedom of Religion
  --- and don't get me started on "Judeo-Christian".) The book has one chapter
  for each of these men, and uses their actual writing to claim that they were
  skeptical of religion and preferred to keep it out of politics. I agree with
  the main ideas of *Moral Minority*, but rather surprisingly (to me), I didn't
  *enjoy* the book. In part this is due to the writing style; it's a lot harder
  to understand 18th-century writing than modern writing. I also think the book
  discusses a lot of facts but doesn't clearly *unify* or *connect* them
  together.

- \*\* **The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason** \*\* is
  Sam Harris's first book, written in 2004 while he was still a Ph.D.
  student[^whataboutme] in neuroscience. Its impact was remarkable: it propelled
  him to fame and played a critical role in forming the [New Atheist
  movement][21].  Harris began writing on September 12, 2001, when the ashes of
  9/11 were well present, and the essay he produced in those weeks of collective
  grief became the basis for this book.  This book is similar to Richard
  Dawkins' *The God Delusion* ([blogged about here][9]) in many ways, in that it
  is highly critical of religion, though to be clear: this is about criticism of
  *sticking to any particular dogma*, not necessarily religion. In fact, Harris
  argues near the end of the book (and this is something I did not know from
  reading Dawkins' book) that Buddhism as a religion is far more an empirical
  science than Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. While Dawkins focuses more on
  the Bible and Koran and argues for evolution instead of creationism and
  intelligent design, Harris here takes more of a "mind and consciousness"
  route, which suits his philosophy and neuroscience academic background.  One
  particular aspect about the book is that he is especially critical of Islam,
  which should not strike readers as surprising, since he argues that religion
  must be the driving force behind suicide bombing, etc.  While I recognize that
  there are many controversial aspects of Sam Harris and his books, I personally
  liked this book a lot and view Harris highly. I agree with him that any
  discussion of religion must begin with the thousands of people who lost their
  lives on September 11, 2001.

- **The Moral Landscape: How Science can Determine Human Values**, a 2010 book
  by Sam Harris, argues that people are mistaken about moral values. He urges us
  to think about improving "well-being" as being equivalent to a peak in a
  hypothetical, non-convex (to use a term from math) "moral landscape". This
  book, while not as anti-religion as his others, dismisses religion as
  something that causes people to be too rigid to change, and creates friction
  over "distractions" (social issues such as gay marriage) when we really should
  be focusing on the threat of terrorism, climate change, and -- of course --
  how to best advance the collective well-being of humans. In my opinion, I was
  reminded of the *Moral Minority* book by Brooke Allen -- I can find myself
  agreeing with the general idea, but I felt like the argument is somewhat
  haphazard and it took me some re-reads of certain paragraphs to get his ideas.
  Honestly, to me his biggest claims come from arguing that there are other
  sciences that are vague and have subjective answers (e.g., health and
  economics) so morality should not be subject to a double standard. Note that
  he has an [interesting discussion of this book on his blog where he challenged
  readers to refute his thesis][4].

- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion** is a 2014 book, *also*
  by Sam Harris, that delves into rather unusual terrain for atheists:
  spirituality. I read this book for two reasons: one is that I know Sam Harris'
  work and admire it very much, and the other is that I have been looking for
  spirituality or "meditation"-related stuff for a while to help decrease
  stress. This book, however, is less a "guide on spirituality" that its title
  suggests, and more about a discussion of the mind, the self, and
  consciousness. That I find really illuminating, albeit considerably difficult
  to understand. I felt lost many times in the book and had to reread certain
  sections, trying to gather every ounce of understanding I could. As an
  atheist, I acknowledge that there are very real benefits of spirituality and
  meditation, *and* that these can be utilized without religion. I want to
  pursue some of these tactics, but preferably those that don't involve drugs,
  as Harris talks about near the end of the book. Ultimately, I was disappointed
  not because it is a bad book, but because I was expecting to get something
  different out of it.

- **Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue**, yet *another* book by Sam
  Harris (co-authored with Maajid Nawaz in 2015) is a conversation between the
  two men, who come from two vastly different backgrounds. Sam Harris is a
  well-known atheist, and I frequently read his blog and books (as highly
  suggested by this blog post!). Nawaz has a remarkable personal story; he was
  born in England, but became radicalized, but then escaped to become a liberal
  Muslim activist.  Harris and Nawaz have a dialogue about Islam and the
  prospects of reforming the faith. Nawaz urges us to have plurality, which will
  lead towards secularism, while Harris argues that we need to start viewing
  Islam directly as the problem because the accurate reading of scripture
  indicates that it is among the more evil of religions. I was impressed that
  two men who no doubt have disagreements can have an honest dialogue, even if
  the difference isn't that great (Nawaz doesn't strike me as a super-religious
  person). But we need a starting point if we are going to counter radical
  Islam. I wrote a [blog post about it earlier this year][15] in the wake of the
  Orlando massacre.


## Group 5: Science

Needless to say, given my "job" as a computer science graduate student, I have
an interest in excellent (popular) science books. Here are four of them. The first
three are physics/earth/biology-related with nontrivial overlap in their topics.
The last one one is a machine learning book.

- **What Evolution Is**, by famed biologist [Ernst Mayr][22], is a 2001 book
  about evolution aimed at the educated non-biologist. It is almost like a
  textbook, but simpler (the book itself is barely 300 pages). Mayr argues that
  evidence is not merely a theory, but a fact, based on the evidence of
  evolution from the fossil record. Mayr takes pains to show that this did not
  come out of a creationist-like reasoning of saying "this is a fact"; rather,
  the current theory of evolution based on natural selection had several
  competing theories when biology was in the early stages as a subject.
  Gradually, as the evidence accumulated, biologists more or less came to a
  consensus on the current "theory". This is an extraordinary example of science
  in action.  Ultimately, I don't quite go as far as Jared Diamond (author of
  [*Guns, Germs, and Steel*][9]), who says that this book is the "second-greatest
  thing" that could ever happen, with the first being if Darwin himself (the
  most famous biologist of all time) came and wrote a book about this. But the
  book is educational since it's written like a pseudo-textbook.  It's somewhat
  dry to read but with enough effort, you can understand the main ideas. 

- **The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History**, by Elizabeth
  Kolbert[^professor], is an engaging fast-paced book arguing that we are in the
  middle of the next mass extinction --- the sixth of the earth's history. (The
  fifth, of course, was the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, a key topic of
  Lisa Randall's book, which I'll describe next!) *The Sixth Extinction*
  consists of a series of short stories documenting Kolbert's adventures across
  the world, where she meets lots of people and explores the outdoors.  Some
  conditions are dangerous, and others are more amusing, as when she recounts
  seeing frogs having sex. But where there is humor is also sadness, because the
  story of extinction is not pleasant.  Kolbert describes how biologists have
  failed to find once-abundant frogs, how zoologists have had to deal with the
  reality of trying to force the two remaining fertile members of a species to
  create offspring, and how the effects of ocean acidification and
  human-accelerated climate change will accelerate extinction. This book,
  however, is not about global warming, as that subject plays only a minor role
  here.  Even discounting global warming, there is irrefutable evidence that
  humans have directly caused the extinction of other species, whether it is
  through construction projects, deforestation, transporting pests across the
  world, and other actions. After reading this book, I continue to remain
  concerned about the future of the world and the fate of our species.

- \*\* **Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the
  Universe** \*\*, by famed cosmologist and physicist [Lisa Randall][23], is an
  exciting book weaving together astronomy, particle physics, earth science, and
  biology, to answer a profoundly interesting question: what caused the
  dinosaurs to die? No, I don't mean about the meteor that hit earth. We know
  all that, and Randall briefly describes the interesting history of how
  scientists arrived at that conclusion. Randall's book is instead about what
  *caused* the meteor to hit the earth. That's a much more challenging question,
  and for someone like me without formal astronomy education, I have no idea how
  people can answer that kind of question considering the immense complexity and
  size of the universe.  Fortunately, Randall explains the astronomy and
  particle physics basics for understanding some of this material. She proposes
  the new, *very preliminary* hypothesis that a disc of dark matter caused the
  meteor to hit the earth. The dark disc in the solar system causes the sun and
  planets to move up and down in unison periodically, and due to certain
  gravitational influences, when passing the *center* of the disc, causes one of
  the meteors (perhaps in [the Oort cloud][11], something cool I learned) to
  dislodge from its orbit and sends it to earth.  After reading *Dark Matter and
  the Dinosaurs*, I can no longer view the universe the same way.  It is an
  exciting world we live in, and though I will not be part of the
  physics/cosmology research that explores Randall's hypothesis, I eagerly await
  what they find and hope that Randall will write another book in five years
  describing her research progress.

- \*\* **The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine
  will Remake Our World** \*\* by Pedro Domingos is one of the few popular
  science books on machine learning, so naturally, I had to read it. It
  describes the history of machine learning as five tribes: symbolists,
  connectionists, analogists, Bayesians, and evolutionaries. This is what I
  wanted to know, so I'm happy he included this in his book. Near the end of the
  book, I felt like Domingos went a bit overboard with storytelling, but it's
  probably better than the alternative of having more math. Certainly *I* would
  prefer more math, but most readers probably don't want that, and we need ways
  to teach machine learning to a broad audience without much math. I have
  covered my thoughts on this book [more extensively in this blog post][16].
  It's an interesting book, to say the least, and I wish there were more books
  about this general area.


## Group 6: NSA and CIA

I maintain an interest in the NSA and the CIA. I chose three related books to
read and I liked *all* of them. This is despite how two books ostensibly appear
to be on the opposite side of a contentious political issue (NSA collection of
bulk metadata). The third is an espionage thriller ... which happens to be true.

- \*\* **No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance
  State** \*\*, is a 2014 book by journalist [Glenn Greenwald][26]. He was one
  of the people who Edward Snowden first contacted about the release of
  classified NSA phone metadata collection documents. The first part of the book
  is quite riveting, since it describes how Snowden first attempted to contact
  Greenwald (via PGP email, but that never happened) and how Greenwald decided
  to go to Hong Kong to meet Snowden.  Greenwald next takes Snowden's side
  regarding the NSA's actions and argues that Snowden is *right* about what the
  NSA does (as in, Snowden's famous "I, sitting at my desk, could wiretap you
  [...] if I had a personal email" phrase). Greenwald displays a number of
  leaked documents to support his arguments. Next, Greenwald argues that
  government spying is bad. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and government
  spying encourages conformity and suppresses valid dissent. One passage that
  particularly struck me was when Greenwald said that the alternative to mass
  surveillance is not *no* surveillance, but *targeted* surveillance. This is a
  lesson that might be useful to many policymakers today.

- \*\* **Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror** \*\*,
  a 2016 book by Michael V. Hayden, the only person to be the director of both
  the National Security Agency and CIA. It is meant to be "an unapologetic
  insider's perspective" on the organizations in a time of terror, but also a
  time of criticism from the general public, who do not understand the
  intricacies of what these agencies do and what they are *legally* bound to do.
  Mr. Hayden frequently mentions that the NSA and CIA are unfairly asked to do
  *more* when the public feels unsafe, but then they're asked to do *less* when
  the public feels safe. Mr. Hayden discussed his time talking to Congress, the
  POTUS (usually Bush 43, but he was also Obama's CIA chief for three weeks),
  and other politicians, in an attempt to keep them as informed as possible, but
  that nonetheless did not seem to satisfy many Libertarians and others who
  oppose aspects of the work of the NSA and CIA. I found this book fascinating
  mostly for the insider's perspective on what it's like to manage such critical
  government organizations, and the careful considerations of these
  organizations when pursuing sensitive strategies (e.g., the metadata
  collection). I wish that there were other secrets he could have discussed, but
  I understand if this is not possible. One possible weakness is that it's more
  of a biography/memoir with loosely related chapters, and doesn't do enough (in
  my opinion, if it was the goal) to *directly* counter people like Glenn
  Greenwald[^glenn_greenwald] and others who oppose NSA bulk collection of phone
  records.

- \*\* **The Billion-Dollar Spy: A True Story of Cold War Espionage and
  Betrayal** \*\* is a 2015 book written by David Hoffman. The book's summary in
  its cover flaps describes it as "a brilliant feat of reporting which unfolds
  like an espionage thriller", and I think this is a valid description. I
  thoroughly enjoyed the book's details on Cold War espionage activities
  performed by the US and the Soviet Union (and this is something getting more
  attention nowadays due to [Obama's much-needed sanctions on Russia][27]). It
  emphasizes how U.S. spies had to carefully communicate with Soviet
  engineer-turned-spy Adolf Tolkachev deep into the heart of Moscow ... and
  several blocks away from the feared KGB. Fortunately, they were able to do
  that for several years, continually communicating with Tolkachev who handed
  over *tens of thousands* of secret documents. The air force said the material
  was worth "roughly in the *billions* of dollars range". Wow. But then, in
  1985, the operation ended due to a shocking betrayal. There are several
  downsides to this book. The first is that the "betrayal" is obvious once the
  appropriate character is introduced, and the second is that it includes some
  nice pictures of the characters and setting, but the pictures should be at the
  *end* of the book (not the middle!) because it gives away the ending. The
  first is a limitation of the story, though, and the alternative would have
  been to expand the book to be longer and introduce more characters early. I
  still greatly enjoyed this book, a riveting and poignant tale of Tolkachev.


## Group 7: Biographies and Memoirs

Here are some biographies and/or memoirs, with quite different themes. Actually,
Michael Hayden's book (from the previous group) would also qualify as a memoir.

- **What I Talk About When I Talk About Running** is the first book by [Haruki
  Murakami][12] that I've read. Murakami is mostly known as a prominent fiction
  writer, both in Japan and abroad, but I decided to read this book since I was
  in the middle of a personal "Running Renaissance" (e.g., see [this blog post
  about running in the Berkeley Marina][13]) and wanted to see his take. This
  book is a short memoir about the notes (most from 2005/2006) Murakami compiled
  while training for the New York marathon.  Along the way, we learn that
  Murakami ran a bar (in Japan) until his thirties, but then started writing and
  struck gold there. He then started running to help him physically manage the
  strain of writing novels. Regarding his running, Murakami describes his
  experience training and running in marathons once a year. He's even run an
  [*ultra*marathon in Lake Saroma][14], which is 62 miles long. This book is
  probably an accurate survey of what Murakami thinks, though I think it suffers
  a lot from cliches: *hard work can beat talent!*, *most people need to work
  hard!*, and so forth. It's a short book so even if one doesn't like the
  concepts, reading it from start to finish does not take much time.

- **Between the World and Me** by Ta-Nehisi Coates, an author (and MacArthur
  Fellow) who I was previously aware of due to his 2014 *The Case for
  Reparations* article. This book won the 2015 National Book Award, so I was
  looking forward to reading it. The best way to describe this book is as a
  cross between a long letter and a poem, and Coates addresses it to his son. He
  argues that, as blacks, they will have to be extra careful about their bodies.
  He says that there is a lot of concern in a world where we've recently seen a
  lot of police officers shooting black men and boys.  (And, tragically, the
  manuscript for this book must have finished before the Charleston shootings,
  which certainly would have made it in otherwise.) One term he uses a lot is
  "The Dream", but paradoxically, it doesn't actually seem to refer to a dream
  for *blacks* (as in, Martin Luther King Jr.'s kind of dream) but that of
  whites who are attempting to define themselves. In terms of my opinion, it's
  true that this book helps me to understand the perspective of being black, and
  obviously made me appreciate not being black[^mixed].  I think Coates could
  have focused more on the shooting cases where the officers were *clearly*
  guilty or had video evidence suggesting that, because in some cases it is
  justified for police officers to retaliate.  Whether they did or not in those
  well-known cases, is not my place to answer, and could be a source of fair
  criticism for this book. As for the *title*, I think it was designed to
  represent how there is a "real" world, one for whites, and "his world" of
  blacks.

- **Sisters in Law: How Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Went to the
  Supreme Court and Changed the World** is a 2015 dual biography by lawyer Linda
  Hirshman. She describes an overview of the Justices' lives, starting from
  childhood, then to their difficulty establishing legal careers, and of course,
  to their time as Supreme Court justices. The book is educational for those who
  want to know about the politics and intricacies of the Supreme Court. I
  certainly count as one of those, so this book was a nice match for me: it was
  just technical and sophisticated enough that I could follow it (along with
  some Wikipedia checks to, for instance, understand what it really means to
  clerk for a judge or to be on the United States Court of Appeals). I also
  learned a lot about how the court works, about how justices have to
  strategically frame their arguments to get a majority, and why it matters who
  writes the opinions. The book talks about Ginsburg's rise, then O'Connor's
  rise, then about them together later. Towards the end of the book, Hirshman
  starts intervening with her personal opinions, as well as her attacks on
  Justice Anthony Kennedy.  Hirshman doesn't shy about inserting her liberal
  beliefs so this may discomfort diehard conservatives (but not moderate
  conservatives, ironically those like O'Connor), and I wonder if she would have
  done something differently had she waited until Kennedy wrote the majority
  opinion which legalized same sex marriage. I enjoyed knowing more of the
  relationships between the Supreme Court justices and how they work, and would
  like to see more of that if the book were to be extended.  Also see the book's
  review on [the "nonpartisan" SCOTUS blog][17], which I mostly agree with.


## Group 8: Miscellaneous

These are some miscellaneous books, which don't seem to fit in the above groups.
I've arranged them by publication date.

- **The Swerve: How the World Became Modern** is a 2011 book by Harvard
  professor Stephen Greenblatt that won the 2011 National Book Award *and* the
  2012 Pulitzer Prize (geez ...). It's the story of how [Poggio Bracciolini][6],
  an Italian scholar and book-hunter in the 14th and 15th century, was able to
  track down Lucretius' *On the Nature of Things*, a dramatic, profound essay
  that had been lost for well over a thousand years, and (incredibly) describes
  things that we take for granted today, especially the atomic nature of the
  world. The book chronicles Poggio's journey to get the book and navigates
  through his life as a papal secretary and, clearly, the trip that led him to
  reach the long-lost manuscript.  Note that this book is technically
  non-fiction, but given that this all happened in the 1400s, I think some of
  its content is bound to be the result of artistic license.  Greenblatt argues
  that this essay "revolutionized our understanding of the world we live in
  today." I thought this book was interesting, though I probably wouldn't be on
  record as saying it was as great as other books I've read, such as *Guns,
  Germs, & Steel*. One thing that might not suit certain readers is the
  anti-religious stance of *On the Nature of Things*, which argues that there is
  no afterlife, so it subscribes to the Epicurean philosophy that life should be
  fulfilled for enjoyment first.  For instance, see [Jim Hinch's criticism of
  the book][5].

- **David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants** is
  another book (from 2013) by the famous author Malcolm Gladwell, who I regard
  as one of the finest authors for explaining how the world works. I thoroughly
  enjoyed reading *The Tipping Point*, *Blink*, and *Outliers* in high school.
  This book is about taking a new perspective of underdogs versus the favorites.
  Why are we surprised when the underdogs win? What if we should *expect*
  underdogs to win? Gladwell discusses how people with disabilities or traumatic
  experiences, while *generally* worse off than others, have a chance of
  overcoming and being stronger than ever. For instance, he cites David Boies, a
  dyslexic lawyer who countered his disability with the ability to listen far
  better, and he is one of the top tax lawyers in the country. He also raises
  the interesting point as to whether it is better to be a big fish in a small
  pond or a little fish in a large pond. The first two parts are my favorite;
  the third part is a bit drier and mostly discusses how people who are in power
  have to consider carefully what happens to those under them (e.g., police
  officers versus civilians, the United States versus (North) Vietnam, etc.).
  Overall, the book, especially the first two parts to me, is thought-provoking
  and I agree with a lot of what Gladwell says. I do, however, have to emphasize
  a criticism of the book that I've seen declared elsewhere: when students who
  are at schools of vastly different prestige study the "same" subject, they are
  *not* studying the same concepts, looking at the same notes, etc. I can say
  this with confidence after studying the material from the artificial
  intelligence and machine learning courses at Williams and at
  Berkeley[^course_nums]. The Williams courses are noticeably easier and cover
  less material than the Berkeley counterparts. And Williams is a very strong
  school in its own right! The gap is therefore wider for other pairs of
  schools.

- **Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam** by Nicholas
  Turse in 2013, is a history book that attempts to account for much of the
  atrocities committed by US soldiers in Vietnam. Most Americans, myself
  included (in 9th grade), were taught that the well-known My Lai massacre was
  just an anomaly, one mistake in an otherwise "appropriate" war. Turse refutes
  this by discussing how American troops were trained to hate Vietnamese
  (including South Vietnamese, ostensibly their allies) and how they committed
  crimes such as torture, rape, and murders (to gain body counts) etc. This was
  not the act of several low-level military folks, but people higher up in the
  commands.  Turse goes over Operation Speedy Express, which he calls "a My Lai
  a month" but which has not gotten as much attention because of efforts by the
  US military to cover up the details.  Yes, this book is frustrating to read,
  and it is not designed to be enjoyable. I don't know how one could be happy
  when reading about what our military did. I knew already that the Vietnam War
  was a mistake just like the Iraq war, and [though there are reviews of Turse's
  book that argue that it doesn't explain the whole truth][24], they can't
  refute that American soldiers killed many innocent Vietnamese civilians. I
  have no doubt that if Vietnam had more military might, population, and power,
  it never would have restored diplomatic relations with the United States.
  Let's not kid ourselves: the reason why we're now "allied" with them today is
  because of our power imbalance (we're "number one") and because we "need them"
  to counter China.

- **Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future** is a 2014 book
  by Peter Thiel that consists of notes from a class on startups that Thiel
  taught at Stanford. How do startups become successful, and what kind of
  people, attitude, and circumstances are necessary for them to flourish and
  ultimately change the world? He laments the fact that America is in a phase of
  "indefinite optimism" instead of the "definite optimism" of the 60s, when we
  landed a man on the moon[^thiel].  Nowadays, people who want money but who
  don't know how to create it become lawyers and investment bankers, a problem
  which Thiel says is exacerbated by today's world which encourages us to focus
  on incrementally improving a variety of skills and focusing on getting top
  grades and so forth (though Thiel was like this in his early life!). The
  entrepreneurs are the ones who can generate wealth, and in order for them to
  succeed, they have to go "from zero to one". That means being like Google,
  which had no comparable peer in terms of searching. While other search engines
  are going from 1 to n and recreating what we know, it's *very difficult* to go
  from 0 to 1. This book is *not* a guide on doing that; such a guide cannot
  exist.  It's just a set of notes, but it's an educational set of notes.  I
  mostly enjoyed the notes, but almost all of it relates to technology startups.
  As Thiel mentions, you can't really apply startup analysis to the restaurant
  industry, so this book caters to a specific group of people, and may possibly
  frustrate those outside the field.

- **Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution** by retired
  Supreme Court Justice [John Paul Stevens][25], is a 2014 book where Stevens
  concisely describes six different ways the US Constitution needs to be
  amended. The reason for *amendment* is that, as he says: "rules crafted by a
  slim majority of the members of the Supreme Court have had such a profound and
  unfortunate impact on our basic law that resort to the process of amendment is
  warranted." (The use of amendment has declined in recent years, as the last
  one was the 27th Amendment in 1992.) Prominent examples Stevens cites are
  political gerrymandering, the death penalty, and gun control. Some of the book
  is written in near-legalese language, but fortunately I was able to follow
  most of the arguments. I can definitely see why he now wants to abolish the
  death penalty (by simply adding "such as the death penalty" to the 8th
  Amendment). Granted, diehard Conservatives obviously won't like this book, but
  Stevens simply aims to state what he thinks must be revised for the
  Constitution, and I agree in many respects.

- **The Road to Character** by David Brooks the "conservative"
  commentator[^notconservative] who writes opinion columns for the New York
  Times. Brooks describes the metaphor of each people having two different
  versions of themselves, "Adam I" and "Adam II". The former is the one we
  emphasize today, which focuses on self-accomplishments, achieving power and
  fame. But he argues that we have lost focus on "Adam II", our moral character,
  who represents the kind of qualities that are discussed in our eulogies.
  These, Brooks argues, are what we want in our legacies. (Brooks concedes,
  though, that the focus on Adam I has helped many people, most notably women
  from breaking out of subservient roles.) Brooks goes through almost ten
  mini-biographies of people including Frances Perkins, Dorothy Day, and Dwight
  Eisenhower, and describes how these people built moral character and focused
  on Adam II instead of Adam I. Then at the end of the book, Brooks summarizes
  the lessons learned for building character.  As for my opinion, I do not
  disagree with Brooks' assessment of today's world; yes, in the civilized
  world, there are so many forces that encourage us to focus on Adam I instead
  of Adam II.  I found Brooks' thoughts on this and his conclusions to be
  interesting and valid. I probably did not enjoy the mini-biographies of people
  that much. This is probably because Brooks deliberately writes in an
  excessively sophisticated manner.

- **Who Rules the World?** is the latest book by Noam Chomsky, possibly the most
  cited academic in the history of the world. (His [Google Scholar account][10]
  shows a ridiculous 306,000 citations as of May 2016!). Chomsky is provocative
  in his writing here, though I suppose I should not have been surprised after
  reading his Wikipedia page. His main argument is that the West (read: the
  United States) thinks they rule the world and can run it the way they want.
  America is therefore the arrogant bully who wants things run his way and
  manipulates the media in doing so. As a side effect, America actually
  *hinders* progress towards some of its goals.  Take the "Iranian nuclear
  threat" for instance. America and the West (myself included) view Iran as one of the gravest
  threats to the world, but this is not the case in the Arab world or elsewhere.
  The Iranian threat could have been resolved many years ago, Chomsky argued, if
  we had not invaded Iraq or invited Iranians to study nuclear engineering at
  his institution (MIT).  Also consider the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.
  The US argues that the PLO does not concede anything in negotiations (in fact,
  Mandelbaum argues just this in *Mission Failure*, described earlier) but
  Chomsky argues that it is Israel and the US who are blocking progress. Of
  course, there is also the threat of climate change in addition to nuclear
  warfare, the two main things that worry Chomsky. And, of course, climate
  change progress is stalling due to the US (more accurately, Republicans, who
  Chomsky accuses of no longer being a political party).  Throughout the book,
  Chomsky criticizes Republicans and also criticizes Democrats for veering to
  the right. I can definitely see why some people will take issue with Chomsky's
  ideas, but this book helped me to take a more critical view of how I
  understand US domestic and foreign policy.

Whew! That's the long list of summaries of the books I read in 2016. I will now
get started on next year's books, once I can find the time ... 

***

[^thrillers]: They were "thriller" type books, but the themes and plots were
    shallow.  If you want to read an excellent thriller book, I think *Battle
    Royale* reigns supreme. Don't get me started about *The Hunger Games* ---
    it's almost a complete rip-off of the decade-older Battle Royale.

[^course_nums]: Currently, at Williams, Artificial Intelligence and Machine
    Learning are numbered CS 373 and CS 374, respectively, while the Berkeley
    counterparts are CS 188 and CS 189.

[^professor]: Interestingly enough, she was a visiting professor at Williams
    College for 2015-2016 (she might still be at Williams, I'm not sure).

[^notconservative]: I do not think David Brooks is really that conservative.
    Perhaps he enjoys being called "liberals' favorite conservative."

[^thiel]: Now that I think about it, this may have been a reason why Thiel
    supported Donald Trump's campaign, going so far as to talk at the Republican
    National Convention. This book was written *before* Donald Trump's campaign,
    though. Thiel, as a Libertarian, was supporting Rand Paul beforehand.

[^wsj]: Like me, he's probably been reading too much of *The Wall Street
    Journal*.

[^alas]: I'm currently reading his book, but alas, as much as I would have liked
    to finish it before 2017, the book is dense and over 700 pages, and I will
    not finish in time.

[^whataboutme]: It looks like I better get around to writing a book.
    "Fortunately" it appears that I will be a PhD student for a long time.

[^mixed]: I have a pet peeve about race, however: why can't we call mixed race
    people by the proper terminology: mixed race? Or, possibly better, we can
    *clearly* list the most accurate approximation of race we have. For me,
    when describing my race, people should state: 50 percent White, 50 percent
    Asian. For Barack Obama, people should state: 50 percent White, 50 percent
    Black. And so on. These aren't true percentages, of course, since all humans
    originate from the same ancestor, but they're as close as we can get.
    Sometimes I wonder if mixed race people exist when I read countless
    statistics saying "X-Y percent white-black" with X+Y=100 and seemingly no
    room for others.

[^glenn_greenwald]: Well, OK he did mention Glenn Greenwald a few times. I
    remember Hayden describing him as "pretty much anti-everything".
