Last night, I participated in a popular American tradition by watching the Super Bowl game. You can read recaps on [The New York Times][2], [ESPN][3], and other sources.

The game itself ended up being a blowout. It was boring to someone like me who doesn&#8217;t actively support either the Denver Broncos or the Seattle Seahawks. I also don&#8217;t watch halftime shows, so that didn&#8217;t increase my excitement of the game.

<span style="line-height:1.5;">The commercials were also a bit of a disappointment, at least compared to the ones in last year&#8217;s Super Bowl. But one of them did catch my eye. No, it was not a Tim Tebow commercial, even though he was arguably the more impressive Denver Broncos-affiliated quarterback last night.</span>

<span style="line-height:1.5;">It was </span>the [Duracell batteries commercial][4], featuring the deaf Seattle Seahawks player Derrick Coleman. In just a single minute, it chronicles his story from a young boy into a current NFL player. It also seems to have inspired [two other deaf girls to write letters of support to Coleman][5]. Imagine their surprise when Coleman met them and offered tickets to the Super Bowl!

Now, I know a lot of deaf people. I actually went on Facebook (!) last night, and saw deaf people supporting the Seattle Seahawks *just because* Coleman was on the team. So his story is inspiring, and clearly has an effect on other deaf people. It will be interesting to see how his career progresses &#8212; he&#8217;s only 23, by the way &#8212; and if other deaf players will join him in the NFL.
