I have now completed the first class sessions for all the courses I'm taking this semester.

And I'm relieved.

I've always found the *first* session to be the most *awkward* of all class sessions. The reason is
that, due to my class accommodations, there are typically two sign language interpreters (or
sometimes in the past, captioners/CART-providers) who show up to the class with me. They sit near
the lecturer, so they're impossible to miss. 

Consequently, when it's the first day of class, I sometimes get paranoid and wonder if students are
constantly thinking about the extra people in the room. Or, worse, what if they're repeatedly
looking at *me*? After all, other students might be curious about who on earth might actually need
such accommodations. When I think about this, my face feels a bit hotter and I sometimes wish I
could hide and blend in like a "normal" student, for once.

That's not to say I *never* want people to think about me. For instance, if I knew students were
thinking something similar to: *wow, that guy over there who needs sign language accommodations must
be reasonably good at this material or possess ability to work extremely hard, given his inherent
disadvantages*, well then perhaps I shouldn't feel so awkward.

Of course, the point is that I *don't* know what other students think of me, so I default to a more
pessimistic view.

The worst part about these first sessions is when the interpreting integration does not go
seamlessly. When this happens, it's usually because someone arrived late to class. One of the most
awkward first class sessions for me occurred back in my sophomore year of college. I was taking
intermediate microeconomics with about 50 students in it. The school administration gave my
interpreters the wrong room number, and I had failed to notify them after only recently finding out
myself. 

This meant that the interpreters showed up *five minutes late* to the first class, after everyone
got seated. They caused a brief interruption, with one interpreter telling me what happened, and the
other one introducing themselves to the professor.

Yes, that was pretty awkward. My face was a little red and I kept my eyes firmly focused on the
board, hoping that the other 50 students wouldn't look at me for more than few seconds.

Don't misunderstand what I'm saying -- there are times when I *really like* the attention. For
instance, as I've stated a few times in this blog, I enjoy giving talks (e.g., [project
presentations][2]), so I like the attention in those cases.

I just don't like being highly visible when it's the first day and a bunch of students who don't
know me have to suddenly get used to the interpreting services in the class.

In addition to bearing the initial awkwardness over the accommodations, I have a few other first-day
concerns. One is that I know I have to *arrive early* to classes to make sure I can get a seat in
the *front* row of the class, preferably at one of its "ends" since that results in the optimal
positioning for me and the sign language interpreters (and probably for the other students; I don't
want to know how annoyed they'd be if the interpreters sat in the *center* of the room).

Due to the [enrollment surge in graduate-level EECS courses][1], if I don't manage to *quickly*
secure one of those coveted front-row seats, then I probably have sit or stand near the
front corner. For me, it's better to stand near the front than sit in the back, but fortunately I've
never had to weigh that tradeoff. In all my classes this semester -- in fact, in *every* class I've
had in recent memory -- I've always been able to secure a front-row seat, but it's still a concern
for me.

Fortunately, with the first class sessions behind me, things should improve. From past experience,
after about four weeks, everyone seems to get used to the interpreters, and a few *wonderful*
students and professors start socializing with them (and me!). 

Furthermore, after the first class, it becomes clearer to me and the interpreters how to best
position ourselves for maximum benefit. I've had to suggest changing our seats a few times.

All right, I guess what I really want to say is that I'm looking forward to my next few classes.
