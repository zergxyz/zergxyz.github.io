Today, I played basketball for the first time since I arrived in Berkeley. It was a lot of fun, and
I was at Berkeley&#8217;s Rec Sports Facility for 1.5 hours. Unfortunately, I also received a
sobering reminder that my water resistant hearing aids are *not* actually water resistant.

My Oticon Sensei hearing aids worked great for about half an hour &#8230; then I heard that
all-too-familiar beeping sequence in both ears, and then a few minutes later, the hearing aids
stopped working. So I didn&#8217;t have any hearing and had to rely on various body language cues
and last-resort tactics (honed over the years) to understand what others were saying. Fortunately,
in basketball, communication among players in game situations tends to be blunt and simple and from
experience, I&#8217;ve learned what players typically say to each other.

It is not uncommon for my hearing aids to stop working while I&#8217;m engaging in some physical
activity. In fact, I get surprised if my hearing aids last through a session of pickup basketball.
Thus, I already knew that I would have to reduce the amount of sweat near my hearing aids. I tried
using my shirt and the gym&#8217;s towel cloth to absorb some of it, but they can only help out so
much.

I understand that water resistant does not mean water proof, but I just cannot fathom how a water
resistant hearing aid stops functioning after a *half hour* of physical activity. Out of curiosity,
I [re-checked my manual][2] and it states that the Oticon Sensei has an IP57 classification. This
means that it was still able to function properly after being immersed in water for 30 minutes at a
depth of 1 meter.

I am somewhat surprised, because 30 minutes is about the time it took for the hearing aids to stop
working after playing basketball. Oh well. At least I have a functional hearing aid *dryer*. Within
a few hours after arriving home, I had them working. But it&#8217;s still incredibly annoying.
Honestly, the biggest problem with hearing aid breakdowns is not the lack of communication *on* the
court, but what happens *off* the court. Between pickup games, players are constantly talking to
each other about who should be playing the next game or what they want to do after
basketball&#8217;s over. A more important issue is that I drive to the gym, and driving without
working hearing aids is something I would rather avoid.
