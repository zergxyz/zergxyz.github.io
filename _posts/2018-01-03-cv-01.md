Starting from today I will use this one as my main blog to share my thoughts on 
my development experience and study summaries. 
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: 

```csharp
private void index(){
  MessageBox.Show("hello world");
}
``` 
### header 3 

sasa 

$L = -\sum_{k}y_k * log(\hat{y_k})$

sa 
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

We can write the network's mathematical meaning using $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{10
\times 100}$$ and $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{784 \times 100}$$ as the weight matrices,
along with $$a \in \mathbb{R}^{10}$$ and $$b \in \mathbb{R}^{100}$$ as the bias
vectors.  Using this, the network output can be expressed as:

$$
P(y=i| x) = 
\frac{\exp\Big(A_i^T\sigma(B^Tx+b)+a_i\Big)}{\sum_{j=0}^9 \exp\Big(A_j^T \sigma(B^Tx+b)+a_j\Big)}
$$
