Starting from today I will use this one as my main blog to share my thoughts on 
my development experience and study summaries. 
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: 

```csharp
private void index(){
  MessageBox.Show("hello world");
}
``` 
### header 3 

sasa 
$$L = -\sum_{k}y_k * log(\hat{y_k})$$ 
sa 
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
