Well, [the news is out][1]. Former Microsoft CEO and current Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer just donated enough money to the Harvard computer science department to fund *twelve* professorships. Twelve! To put that in perspective, that&#8217;s 50% more than the total number of computer science professors at Williams College, and about half of the current size of Harvard&#8217;s CS faculty.

While it&#8217;s no doubt thrilling to see the attention that computer science is getting nowadays, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice this little segment from The Crimson:

> “Right now I think everybody would agree that MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon are the top places [for computer science],” Ballmer said, adding that some would also include the University of California at Berkeley. “I want Harvard on that list.”

Wait a second, did Ballmer just exclude Berkeley from the Stanford, CMU, and MIT group? Last I checked, [they were all clustered together at rank one][2] &#8230; perhaps the exclusion is related to how Berkeley&#8217;s a public university? I can&#8217;t really think of any other reason. And while he *did* mention the school, don&#8217;t you think that if he viewed the top schools as a group of four, he would have said &#8220;I think everyone would agree that MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and Berkeley are the top places [&#8230;]&#8221; instead?

Anyway, I hope Berkeley can maintain its reputation for the next few years. This is mainly so that people will be willing to take me seriously at a first glance/conversation when discussing research; beyond that, of course, they&#8217;ll care more about your actual record than the school you go to. But it *helps* to go to a highly-ranked school. And I&#8217;m sure that some of Harvard&#8217;s new faculty members will have gotten their Ph.D.s from Berkeley. Incidentally, the fourth and fifth year students at Berkeley who have strong publication records must be feeling ecstatic.
