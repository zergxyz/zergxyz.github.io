As 2014 nears, I face the realization that I will have a free summer. If all
goes well, it will be the summer after college and before graduate school. I do
not think I will be doing an internship so that gives me the freedom to explore
some topic in further detail. Given my interests and the realities of my future
career options, I thought it would be prudent to pursue a programming project of
my choosing.

<span style="line-height:1.5;">I have some ideas which I&#8217;ll list below, but nothing&#8217;s
set in stone. (Other ideas are listed <a href="http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/">here</a> and
<a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/">here</a>.) I&#8217;ll probably do a few of them to start and
narrow down on one. I&#8217;ll do my best to describe the project once it gets started, probably by
posting it on Seita&#8217;s Place. And if readers have suggestions, feel free to
email me (see [About][1]).

***Making a Game***

I might as well discuss this one first, since many programming projects fall into this category. I was thinking of some minor online text-based game, possibly in a role-playing genre. For now, I&#8217;ll abstain from getting too involved in graphics and other parts necessary for a game, since I feel like that will detract from the pure programming parts. I&#8217;m a little worried that there will be a lot of work in getting simple stuff like saving the game or logging in/out, but perhaps that&#8217;s important for me to know.

***Making an App***

I am interested in creating an app that assists with education, such as an app that describes course notes in a subject I&#8217;m comfortable with (e.g., Artificial Intelligence) or one that is like a &#8220;mini-textbook.&#8221; The downside is that most users will probably just use their laptops if they want to access notes.

***Making Basic but Useful Software***

What I mean with this is that I&#8217;ll attempt to make something that I might actually use in the future. For instance, I could theoretically make my own text editor, and I would use it in the rest of my career. (This is pure fantasy, though, because emacs and vim are perfectly fine for what I do and there&#8217;s no way I could build something that complicated.) The difficult part with this idea is coming up with something that could be useful to me or others and hasn&#8217;t already been built in a better way.

***Do Something Based Off of a Class***

The advantage with this idea is that it&#8217;s less likely I&#8217;ll get lost, since substantial programming assignments as part of a class tend to have specific instructions and starter code. I don&#8217;t want to follow a project like this exactly, since that will stifle creativity, but at least things will be more structured. I feel like this is a lame objective to pursue, though&#8230;.

***Join an Open-Source Project***

This could be interesting &#8230; the questions is, which ones interest me and would be open to a programmer helping this out for a summer?
