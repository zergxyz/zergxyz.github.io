This was a nice article that explains how some of the games I played as a youth were NP-hard. I suppose that makes me feel better that I was such a great player. I&#8217;ve read part of this and will read it completely after my finals.

EDIT (July 2013): So it took a little longer than I thought for me to finish reading. I was fairly impressed with these results, though I can understand if some &#8220;serious&#8221; scientists might not think highly of these. Professor [Erik Demaine][2] lists this article as a *manuscript**, *so it looks like it hasn&#8217;t been accepted into a prestigious conference.

The paper itself is easy reading, and you don&#8217;t have to be an expert in theory to understand the big idea. The techniques mostly rely on reducing the game to a set of really simple rules.
