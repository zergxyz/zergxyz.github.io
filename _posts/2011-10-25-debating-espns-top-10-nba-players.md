Much to my chagrin, the NBA has been in a lockout for well over 110 days. With no agreement coming in sight, I’m losing hope on there being an NBA season. The only upside to this is that my favorite team, the Dallas Mavericks, can be considered defending champions for a second year despite winning only one championship.

With the lockout in place, there was little for the NBA to write about … except ranking five hundred NBA players. The actual rankings concluded a few days ago, with LeBron James nabbing top honors. Since ESPN constantly has these 5-on-5 debates about the validity of these rankings, I decided to provide my own input, just for fun. As you can see, for most of the top 10, the rankings were solid.

### LeBron James at No. 1: Too high, too low or just right?

This feels like beating on a dead horse, but this is THE ranking that simply can’t be contested. It
doesn’t matter that LeBron is arguably the most arrogant player in the league and proclaimed that he
and the Heat would win not 1, not 2, ... not 5 titles. They failed to win in the finals largely due to
his disappearing act in the 4th quarter, but that doesn’t negate all the work he did throughout the
first three rounds. He showed throughout the Bulls series that he could shut down the league MVP,
and he showed throughout the entire season that he is currently the best player on the planet. And
he’s still just 26 years old.

### Dwight Howard at No. 2: Too high, too low or just right?

This is also just right. It doesn’t matter if Howard is limited offensively beyond the paint – he’s
the best center in the league by far in a weak yet important position. Before people bring up his
atrocious free throw percentage, I’d like to find another player who could make a roaring dunk
through three men in the paint, then beat a point guard back to the other end of the court and whack
his shot into the stands. Heck, look at how he [grabbed Chris Quinn&#8217;s
layup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0HoDopuc9w) Of course, he would turn the rock over in the
next few seconds, which shows why he isn&#8217;t #1.

### Dwyane Wade at No. 3: Too high, too low or just right?

Just right, which makes it all the more amazing that the Heat weren’t able to win it all this season since star power gets magnified as teams shrink to 7 and 8-men rotations in the playoffs. Wade notably struggled in a few games this season while adjusting to his new role as a co-superstar, but he still maintained his precocious aggressiveness and defensive ability to earn a top-3 ranking in the league. Agenda for next season: work on that 3-point shot.

### Chris Paul at No. 4: Too high, too low or just right?

Even though he’s arguably the best point guard in the league, I think this ranking is too high. Paul was battling some injuries throughout this season, and was weaker than his otherworldly 2008-2009 season. People will point out his impressive Lakers series, where Paul averaged 22 points and 12 dimes a game while shooting almost 55% from the field, but I’ll point out that, while impressive, the achievement gets tainted with Derek Fisher on the defensive end. While he is a beauty to watch on the court, a point guard who averages below 16 and 10 simply can’t be in the top 5 in the NBA.

### Dirk Nowitzki at No. 5: Too high, too low or just right?

Even as a Dallas fan, I would have said too high last year … but THIS year? This is just right. We’re looking at the man who led a team, composed of scattered veterans with no other All-stars, to an NBA championship. That essentially put the seal on his first-ballot Hall of Fame resume, and removed him from the discussion of the best player in NBA history without a title. His 2011 playoff performance was memorable, with scintillating moments like his 48-point performance against Oklahoma City and his Game 2 rally to lead the Mavs past the Heat in a thriller. Most surprisingly for him, he’s shown improvement on the defensive end of the court.

### Kevin Durant at No. 6: Too high, too low or just right?

This ranking is a tad too low, and I’ll argue this by pointing out that Durant’s a 2-time scoring champ who’s improved his rebounding from last season, all while playing alongside another burgeoning star in Russell Westbrook. He’s never going to be mistaken for Artest on the defensive end, but when he’s active on the boards – as he often is – he’s contributing on the defensive end, and as we’ve been privileged to see, his offense is beautiful. He still has some work to do to reach Nowitzki-like field goal percentages, but he’s got a huge future ahead of him at age 23, and I would like to see him switch spots with Paul on these rankings.

### Kobe Bryant at No. 7: Too high, too low or just right?

As much as Kobe fans will hate this, rank 7 for number 24 is just right. There’s no doubt he’d be ranked a little higher if it weren’t for the Lakers’s unfortunate playoffs, but that’s just how the rankings work (otherwise, Dirk would be in the 10-15 range). While his efficiency did not deteriorate much this season, his minutes per game and defensive ability both declined, which are both reasons why he’s currently out of the top five in the rankings despite his hall-of-fame resume. I find it more impressive that a 15-year veteran is still in the top 10, regardless of his ranking.

### Derrick Rose at No. 8: Too high, too low or just right?

Just right. He went from a good guard last year to a great guard this year, and is arguably in the top tier along with Chris Paul and Deron Williams. He improved his shooting (three point percentage boosted by 6%) and passing (assists per game up to 7.7) from last season to earn his first season MVP award. At 22 years of age, Rose can only go up from here. Keys for next season: cut down on turnovers, and don’t try to shoot 20-feet fadeaways over LeBron James in a conference finals game.

### Deron Williams at No. 9: Too high, too low or just right?

Just right. It might seem like Williams had a down year since he was injured and had to adjust to a new team after Utah’s blockbuster mid-season trade. But even though he played just 65 games total this season, his points-per-game were at a career high and he proved that he wasn’t all about scoring when he dished over 12 dimes per game in New Jersey. And if you can accomplish that with a rebound-phobic Brook Lopez as your second best player, that’s amazing. That’s the sign of a star player, and someone who rightfully belongs in the top 10.


### Blake Griffin at No. 10: Too high, too low or just right?

Just a tad to high. I’m not going along with the “Blake-Griffin-is-overrated-and-can’t-do-anything-other-than-dunk” bandwagon. We just saw a rookie dominate the league by putting up 20-10 every night and making opposing centers scared to contest his dunks. Yes, he could use some improvement on the defensive end, but when Dirk, Bryant, and Durant are above him, it shows that you don’t have to be Bill Russell in order to make the top 10. Regardless, he’d be better suited in the 15-20 range.
