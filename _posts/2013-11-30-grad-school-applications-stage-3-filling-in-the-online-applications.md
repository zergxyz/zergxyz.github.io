It seems like every prospective graduate student is using the Thanksgiving break to catch up on applications. That&#8217;s definitely been my situation; I&#8217;ve delayed things far too long (which is quite unlike me), but hopefully I have made up for it these past few days by submitting several fellowships/scholarships and creating final drafts of my statement of purpose essays. With ten schools and a variety of fellowships/scholarships to apply to, I can&#8217;t afford to leave everything to the last week before the schools&#8217;  deadlines, especially when that also happens to correspond to my final exam week!

To budget my time, I first submitted all the fellowships and scholarships that had deadlines earlier than that of any of my ten graduate schools. Then, I went to work on creating draft after draft of one school&#8217;s statement of purpose essay. Fortunately, most universities have similar essay questions, so I can just modify a paragraph at the end that is school-specific.

Once I had done sufficient work for one essay, I put that aside and then did all the &#8220;administrative&#8221; tasks by filling in the easy stuff of the online applications. This includes writing information about recommenders, writing your address and contact information, and so on.

Some thoughts as I was doing these:

  1. I did them in bulk fashion (i.e., one right after another) and did everything <em style="color:#000000;">except</em> upload the statement of purpose essays. I felt like that was the most efficient way to do things. Now, when I head back to school, I only have to worry about the essays.
  2. Most applications were part of a university-wide graduate school application form, so I frequently read information that was not relevant to computer scientists but would be relevant to other subject areas. This makes it a little harder on the applicant (since we have to fill in more information than is probably necessary) but it&#8217;s easier on the school (only one application website/form needed for the entire graduate school) so I can understand why schools like that.
  3. Some places want me to paste my essay into a &#8220;text box,&#8221; while others want uploaded PDF documents. I vastly prefer the latter, since there is some LaTeX stuff that I&#8217;ve included in my statement of purpose to make it look better, but maybe schools don&#8217;t want faculty to be influenced by the aesthetics of the text.
  4. Some schools weren&#8217;t specific about whether they wanted me to upload an unofficial transcript or a scanned official transcript. (One school even had contradictory information in two places of their application.) In fact, for two schools, I didn&#8217;t realize this until I had actually reached the point in the application where they asked me to upload scans. Fortunately, the registrar emailed me a PDF scan of my official transcript and that solved everything. The lesson is that it&#8217;s best to just get an official scan to not leave anything to chance.
