Soon after my junior year at Williams College, I went to see a movie with some friends at a local
Regal Cinema theater.

Yes, a real movie at a real theater.

It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been to one, because I have to first check that I&#8217;m
interested in the movie and that &#8212; more importantly &#8212; the theater provides captions.

But on that day, I had the fortune of trying out these [closed-captioning glasses][1]. Instead of
having the captions appear on the screen with the movies, they are essentially projected
holographically by the glasses. Thus, moving the glasses (e.g. by rotating one&#8217;s head) will
cause the captions to shift. Apparently, this is all new technology that&#8217;s been finalized in
2012 or 2013. Even though I&#8217;ve only used them once, I can already see some of the benefits and
drawbacks to this device.

***Pros***

First of all, these captioning glasses clearly work. It can take a couple of minutes to get used to
it, though, since the captions won&#8217;t be in the same spot all the time unless one has abnormal
neck-stabilizing ability.

But the even bigger benefit is that caption services can be provided for *all *movies at supported
Regal theaters. Now, we won&#8217;t have to deal with hearing people ranting about annoying captions
clogging up the screen. Instead, they&#8217;ll be complaining about the quality of their seats or
other picayune matters.

***Cons***

While I didn&#8217;t really have any issues with stabilizing the captions, I can see why some would
feel uncomfortable with a non-stable reading location. I also remember that there was a slight issue
with the color of the text. I believe the text is some yellow-green color (I&#8217;m colorblind, so
this is my best guess) and it can sometimes blend in with the screening.

Finally, since I wear prescription glasses, I had to take some extra time to adjust the captioning
glasses so they could fit outside of the ones I wear daily. People with especially large or bulky
prescription glasses may have a more difficult time wearing a second pair of glasses.

***Conclusion***

This is yet another example as to how today&#8217;s world has become unquestionably more accessible
to deaf people than in previous eras. It&#8217;s also what I would consider a [deaf-friendly
tactic][2]. Now, the next step would be to accomplish the harder task of having these glasses
for *everyday *use. That means if I&#8217;m wearing them, the captions should display what someone
is saying to me in real time. (Actually, this is theoretically impossible, but we need to aim high,
right?)
