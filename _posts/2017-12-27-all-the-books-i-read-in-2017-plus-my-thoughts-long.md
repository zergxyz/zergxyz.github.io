---

A year ago, I [listed all the books that I read in the year 2016][34]. I listed
35 books with summaries for each, and grouped them into categories by subject.
I'm pleased to announce that I am continuing my tradition with this current blog
post, which summarizes all the books I read in 2017.

As before, I am only listing non-fiction books, and am excluding (among other
things) textbooks, magazines, and *certainly* all the academic papers[^academic]
that I read. Books with starred titles (like \*\* **this** \*\*) are those that
I especially enjoyed reading, for one reason or another.

In 2017, I read **43 books**, which is eight more than the 35 I reported on last
year. Yay! The book categories are:

1. Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (11 Books)
2. Technology, Excluding AI/Robotics (5 Books)
3. Business and Economics (5 Books)
4. Biographies and Memoirs (6 Books)
5. Conservative Politics (3 Books)
6. Self-Help and Personal Development (3 Books)
7. Psychology and Human Relationships (4 Books)
8. Miscellaneous (6 Books)

Within each section, books are listed according to publication date.

I hope you enjoy this blog post! For 2018, I hope to continue reading lots and
lots of non-fiction books with a heavy focus on technology, businesses, and
economics.



## Group 1: Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

Yowza! From the 11 books here, you can tell that I'm becoming a huge fan of this
genre. ;-)

- \*\* **Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain** \*\* is a thrilling 2011
  book by neuroscientist [David Eagleman][8] of the Baylor College School of
  Medicine. (I consider this book as "AI" in this blog post, though you could
  argue that "Psychology" might be better.) It is clearly designed for the lay
  reader with interest in neuroscience, like me, due to a number of engaging
  examples that thrill the reader without going overboard with the technical
  content. Eagleman describes how we don't actually have that much control over
  our brain, that there are so many unexpected contradictions with how we think,
  and mentions a few interesting neuroscience factoids.  Did you know, for
  instance, that half of a child's brain can be removed and [the child can
  *still* survive][51]?  On a technical note, I was impressed with how Eagleman
  referenced a few machine learning papers from Michael I.  Jordan and Geoff
  Hinton in his footnotes about hierarchical learning. From the perspective of a
  computer scientist, the most interesting part was when he talked about the
  brain being a team of competing rivals. This is awfully similar to the idea
  behind [Generative Adversarial Networks][9] an enormously successful and
  well-cited paper that came out in NIPS 2014 ...  three years *after* this book
  was published! I have no idea how a non-computer scientist was able to almost
  predict this, but it shows that cross-collaboration between neuroscientists
  may be good for AI. He doesn't get *everything* right, though.  He mentions
  more than once that artificial neural networks have been a failure. Well...
  this book was published in 2011, and Alex-Net came out in 2012, so that kind
  of flopped quickly.  Despite this, I hope to see Eaglemen write another book
  about the brain so that I can see a revised perspective.  *Incognito* also
  contains interesting perspectives on neuroscience and the law.  Eagleman
  doesn't take sides but doesn't go in too much depth either. He says the "bar"
  for blameworthiness will change depending on available neuroscience, which he
  says is a mistake (and I agree).

- \*\* **The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About
  Being Alive** \*\* is an engaging 2011 book written by Brian Christian, who
  also (co-)authored another book I read this year, *Algorithms to Live By*.
  This book's main focus is on the Turing Test, and it plays a greater theme in
  this one more than any of the other AI books I've read. Simply put, while
  we're so obsessed about getting a computer to fool human judges (the "most
  human computer"), Christian argues that an equally important criteria is the
  "most human *human*." In other words, in the Turing Test, who is the human
  that can most convince the judges that he/she is human? The book's chapters
  are explorations of the different factors that make us human, among other
  things our ability to barge and interrupt, our use of "um" and "uh", our
  constant sidetracking, and so forth. Intuitively, these are hard for a
  computer to model. Christian has a computer science background, so some of the
  book covers technical concepts such as entropy, which he argues we need to be
  making as high as possible; low entropy means we're not saying anything worth
  knowing more about. And yet, these seem to be the most *negatively* encouraged
  aspects of our society, which is quite odd in Christian's opinion. I enjoyed
  reading most of the book because it stated observations that seem obvious to
  me in retrospect, but which I never gave much thought. That's the best kind of
  observation. (It's like *Incognito* to some extent, and indeed the Incognito
  author praises this book!) The biggest drawback is that it never goes through
  a blow by blow of the *actual* Turing test! I mean, c'mon, I was looking
  forward to that, and Christian essentially ruined it by fast forwarding to the
  end, when he mentions he *won* the title of the "most human human." Well,
  congratulations dude, but why wasn't there at least a complete transcript in
  the book???

- \*\* **Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human
  Era** \*\* is a 2013 book by documentary filmmaker James Barrat exploring the
  rise of AI and its potential existentialist risk. This is not far off the
  mainstream of AI researchers and programmers as it sounds. In fact, Peter
  Norvig and Stuart Russell include a brief discussion about it at the end of
  their famous AI textbook. Russell has also explicitly said that [he's clearly
  worried about superintelligence][10]. So what is superintelligence? I view it
  as AI that is so far advanced that it becomes better and better, and surpasses
  humans in just about every quality imaginable.[^russell] I think I enjoyed
  reading this book, even if it is a tad too sensational.  There isn't that much
  technical detail, which is OK since it's a popular science book. Barrat makes
  an excellent point that scientists need to make their work accessible to the
  public.  I agree --- that's partly why I discuss technical stuff on this blog
  --- but I also think that people have *got* to start learning more math on
  their own. It needs to be a two-way partnership.  Moving on, an unexpected
  benefit of reading *Our Final Invention* was that I learned about the work
  done by I.J. Good, Eliezer Yudowsky, and others from the Machine Intelligent
  Research Institute. I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't know about those
  two people beforehand, but now I will remember their names. Unlike MIRI in
  most Berkeley AI research groups, such as the ones I'm in, we don't give a
  modicum of thought to existential risks of AI, but the topic [is garnering
  more attention][12]. One final comment about the book: Barrat mentions that no
  computer is better than a child at object recognition.  Well, whoops.  They
  are now! He talks a lot about neural networks and how we don't understand
  them, which by now feels old and I wish authors would take note of all the
  people workong on this area. I'd like to see an updated version of *Our Final
  Invention* in 2018, with the last five years of AI advancement taken into
  consideration.

- \*\* **Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies** \*\* is a 2014 book by
  Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom.[^accused] His philosophy background is
  apparent in the way *Superintelligence* is written, though it is obviously
  much easier to read than a real, academic philosophy paper. In this book,
  Bostrom considers when AI grows to the point where machines are
  "superintelligent." That term can be broadly understood as when machines are
  so powerful and intelligent that they effectively have complete control over
  the future of the universe. Why, Bostrom says, can we assume that
  superintelligence is friendly? We cannot, he concludes. The book is about
  different ways we can *get* to superintelligence (i.e., "paths") including AI,
  emulating the brain, collective superintelligence (think a super-charged
  Internet) and so forth. There are also "dangers" and "strategies". Bostrom
  convincingly explains why superintelligence poses an existential risk to
  humanity, and also explains what strategies we may take to counter it, such as
  by uploading appropriate values to the agent.  Unfortunately, none of his
  solutions are clear-cut. There are two things you will notice when reading
  this book.  First, *almost every assumption has a counterexample or unexpected
  consequence*. Bostrom often comes up contrived scenarios for this purpose.
  Second, Bostrom frequently cites Eliezer Yudkowsky's work. I first learned
  about Yudkowski by reading James Barrat's *Our Final Invention* (see above).
  If you like Yudkowsky, you'll like Bostrom.  Taking a more general view,
  *Superintelligence* is meant to be a serious academic-style discussion, but
  *not* a recipe that can be easily followed, because it assumes so many things
  and continues to make the reader feel like every case is hopelessly
  complicated with advantages and disadvantages abound, both obvious and
  non-obvious.  Overall, I'm happy I read this book even if it is wildly
  premature. It made me think hard about any assumptions I make in my work.

- **What to Think About Machines That Think: Today's Leading Thinkers on the Age
  of Machine Intelligence** collects responses based on a 2015 survey of the
  EDGE question: "what do you think about machines that think?" This was sent to
  about a hundred or so experts in a variety of fields, mostly different
  academics and well-known authors. Obvious inclusions were Nick Bostrom (of
  *Superintelligence* fame), Eliezer Yudkowsky, Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig,
  and others, but there were also some interesting new additions. I of course
  did not know the vast majority of the people here. This book is a bit of an
  unusual format; each author's answer to this question took up 1-4 pages.
  There were no constraints otherwise, so the answers varied considerably. For
  instance, I like Steven Pinker's comment of why people don't think AI will
  "naturally develop along female lines [...] without the desire to take over
  the world." Gee, isn't that stereotyping, Pinker?? There were also some
  amusing responses, such as when someone said that he himself was an AI and
  people didn't know it (!!) as well as alarmingly short answers saying
  "machines can't think". Most responses were along the same theme of: "AIs
  taking over the world aren't going to happen anytime soon, but they are
  affecting us *now*, sometimes in subtle ways, and [insert 'novel' insight
  here]." Overall, while I like the idea of the book format, I think the utility
  that I derive from reading is more about understanding a long, engrossing
  story. This is not necessarily a *bad* book, and I can see it being useful for
  someone who can only read books in short 3-5 minute spurts at a time, but it's
  not my style.

- \*\* **Machines of Loving Grace: The Quest for Common Ground Between Humans
  and Robots** \*\*, is a 2015 book by *NY Times* journalist John Markoff.
  Though a journalist, Markoff has frequently written about AI-related topics
  and has good connections in the field. *Machines of Loving Grace* gives an
  impressively balanced view of the history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
  Intelligence Augmentation (IA), which can be roughly thought of as HCI (I
  might view it as a *subset* of HCI). Obviously, I am more interested in the AI
  aspect. Markoff covers topics such as self-driving cars (unsurprisingly), and
  Rodney Brooks' *Baxter* robot, which has been used in many research papers
  that I've read. But more surprising from a Berkeley perspective, Markoff also
  mentioned Pieter Abbeel's work, though this was his [clothes folding
  experiment][30], and not his later, more exciting DeepRL stuff from 2014 and
  onwards. I was also --- unsurprisingly --- interested in Markoff's description
  of the history of how the neural network pioneers met each other (e.g.,
  Terence Sejnowski, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun). For the IA side, the most
  prominent example is Apple's Siri, which interacts with humans, though I don't
  have much to say about it because I have never used Siri. Yes, I'm
  embarrassed. On the AI vs IA dilemma, Markoff notes people such as John
  McCarthy and Doug Engelbart on opposite sides. And of course who could forget
  Marvin Minsky who decimated the field of neural networks with his legendary
  1969 book? I decided to read this based on [Professor Ken Goldberg's brief
  Nature article][29], and was pleased that I did so, mostly (again) to learn
  about history (since I'm trying to become like one of those AI experts...) and
  the importance of ensuring that, at least for AI *applied to the real world*,
  we keep the human interaction aspect in mind.

- **Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future** is a
  2015 book by technologist Martin Ford, who warns that our society is not
  prepared to handle all the future technological advances with robots
  automating out jobs. He begins by arguing that IT advances have not been as
  useful as electricity and other breakthroughs, and indeed that is a key theme
  from Robert Gordon's *The Rise and Fall of American Growth*. To make the point
  clear, in response to Ray Kurzwiel saying that smartphones have provided
  incalculably large benefits to their owners, Ford counters with: "in practice,
  they may offer little more than the ability to play Angry Birds while standing
  in an unemployment line." Ford continues by citing sources and reasons for the
  decline of the middle class in America. This part of the book is not
  controversial. Ford then raises the point that the IT revolution, along with
  not just robotics but also *machine learning*, means that even "high-skilled"
  jobs are at risk of being automated out. We now have machines that can write
  as well as most humans, that play Jeopardy! (as expected, IBM's Watson was
  mentioned) and which perform better at image recognition and language
  translation using Deep Learning. Ford worries that, in the worst case, an
  elite few with all the wealth will hoard it and be guarded in a fortress by
  robots. Yes, he admits this is science fiction (and he discusses the
  Singularity, probably not the best idea...) but the point seems clear.  Ford
  concludes the book with what he probably wanted to discuss all along:
  Universal Basic Income to the rescue!  I heard about this book from [Professor
  Ken Goldberg's brief Nature article][29], who is critical of Ford "falling for
  the singularity hype" and his "extremely sketchy" evidence. I probably don't
  find it as bad, and lately I've been thinking more seriously about supporting
  a Universal Basic Income. We might as well try on smaller scales, given that
  the best we can hope for in the future is more debt and safety net cuts with
  Republicans (now) or more debt inefficient bureaucracy with Democrats (in
  2018/2020).

- **Our Robots, Ourselves: Robotics and the Myths of Autonomy**, a 2015 book
  written by MIT professor [David A. Mindell][31], is the *third*
  robotics-related book that I read based off of [Professor Ken Goldberg's brief
  Nature article][29]. Mindell has an unusual background, being a Professor of
  Aeronautics *and* Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing (I
  didn't even know that was a department).  He's also a pilot. So this book
  brings together his expertise when he discusses what it means for robots to be
  automated. *Our Robots, Ourselves* discusses five realms: sea, land, air, war,
  and space, and shows that in all of those, it is not straightforward to claim
  that robots are being more and more autonomous at the expense of the human
  aspect. In addition, Mindell tells stories of the natural conflict between
  increasing automation and human employees. For instance, with sea, what does
  it mean for geologists and scuba-diving analysts if robots do it for them?
  Does it detract from their job?  A similar thing rings true for pilots.  We
  need some way of humans taking over in emergencies, and pilots are worried
  that increasing automation will lower the prerequisite skills for the job
  and/or reduce the job's purpose. Next, consider war. People who once fought on
  the front lines or as air force pilots are feeling resentful that those who
  manage drones remotely are getting respect and various honors. Mindell argues
  that increasing automation must also go along with better *human-robot
  interaction*, a topic which is rightfully becoming increasingly important for
  academia and the world. After reading this book, I now believe I do *not* want
  systems to be fully autonomous (a huge issue with self-driving cars) but
  instead, I want the *automation to work well with humans*.  That's the key
  insight I got from this book.

- \*\* **Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions** \*\*
  is a 2016 book co-authored by writer Brian Christian and Berkeley psychology
  professor Tom Griffiths. It consists of 11 chapters, each of which correspond
  to one broad theme in computer science, such as *Bayes' Rule*, *Overfitting*,
  and *Caching*. Most of these topics are related to algorithms and machine
  learning, which wasn't particularly surprised to me given the authors'
  backgrounds. I also know Professor Griffiths publishes machine learning papers
  on occasion, such as his groundbreaking 2004 paper [*Finding Scientific
  Topics*][48]. *Algorithms to Live By* lists how the major technical issues and
  questions related to these topics can have implications for actions in our own
  lives, such as dating, parking cars, and designing our rooms/desks (this
  example with caching *always* comes up). The authors point out how, in
  practice, the algorithms people engage in for these activities can be
  surprisingly correct or well off the mark of optimality, where here the metric
  is based on mathematical proofs. Of course, whenever we talk about
  mathematical proofs, we have to be clear on *what assumptions we make*, which
  will drastically affect our options, and which in fact can often validate some
  of the seemingly irrational activities that humans perform. I *tremendously*
  enjoyed reading this, though admittedly it was easier for me to digest the
  material given that I knew the main idea of the computer science concepts
  covered. It was nice to get a high-level overview, though, and I *still*
  learned a lot from the book since I have not studied every computer science
  subfield in detail.  My final thought is that, just like when I read *The
  Checklist Manifesto* last year and tried to think about utilizing checklists
  myself, I will try and see if I can incorporate some of the authors'
  suggestions in my own life.

- \*\* **Thinking Machines: The Quest for Artificial Intelligence and Where It's
  Taking Us Next** \*\* is a recent 2017 book by journalist Luke Dormehl. I
  found out about it by reading [Ray Kurzweil's favorable book review in *The
  New York Times*][14]. Kurzweil remarks that Luke is a journalist who "actually
  knows the technical details." I think that's true, though there is virtually
  no math in this book, or at least very little of it compared to [Pedro
  Domingos' book][49]. In *Thinking Machines*, Dormehl mentions the
  backpropagation algorithm which has powered Deep Learning, but only at a very
  high level (obviously). He also talks about Deep Learning's history, which I
  know already (and it could have been derived right from Stanford's CS 231n
  slides) but it's good to have here.  Dormehl writes about the by-now famous
  story that "neural networks were ignored for a while then they became popular
  and are now known as Deep Learning," which Professor Jitendra Malik would
  remark is "more marketable." As far as technical material goes, it's correct,
  so no worries.  Dormehl includes a substantial amount of material about
  sensors, the Internet of Things (similar to Thomas L. Friedman's *Thank You
  For Being Late*) and of course about AI ethics, laws, and the singularity.
  These are not new themes, but the difference between this book and others is
  that it's very recent and current, which is useful due to the fast-growing
  pace of AI, so it was able to cover AlphaGo from DeepMind. I consider it a
  broad "story" about AI, and less opinionated compared to James Barrat's *Our
  Final Invention*. It's of reasonable length (not too long, not too short) and
  great for a wide audience of readers.  Overall, I enjoyed reading the book,
  and it kept me up late longer than I should have.

- \*\* **Heart of the Machine: Our Future in a World of Artificial Emotional
  Intelligence** \*\* is a 2017 book [also recommended by Ray Kurzweil][14].
  The author is [Richard Yonck][19], founder and president of *Intelligent
  Future Computing*, a company which provides advice on the impact of technology
  on business and society (is this called "consulting"?). *Heart of the
  Machine*, like many AI-related books, discusses recent research and commercial
  advances, but it emphasizes an *emotional* perspective. It discusses how we
  got to *affective computing* and the rise of emotional machines.  The first
  part contains a little history and discusses some of the labs that are working
  on this (e.g., the MIT Media Lab).  The second, like the first, shows how many
  companies are measuring emotions, in part using advances in AI and Big Data
  analysis, and cautions us about the [*uncanny valley*][50]. The third part of
  the book is about the future, and obviously sexbots play a role.  What I
  remember most form the book are its anecdotes, one of the most touching of
  which was when someone wanted to marry a robot, and a parent opposed this.
  Will this be the future of marriage? The first step is interracial marriage,
  then the next is same-sex marriage, and the last (?) step is human-machine
  marriage. Yonck shows his academic side by citing some ACM/IEEE *International
  Conference on Human-Robot Interaction* papers.  That's a niche-style
  conference but will likely grow into something much larger in the coming years
  ([see the 2018 website here][20]), similar to how NIPS grew from a niche into
  an enormous conference with thousands of attendees each year.  Finally, I
  appreciated that Yonck said we are *already* merging with technology in some
  ways. For instance, many deaf people opt for cochlear implants to better
  interact in a hearing world.  (I likely would have one had I been born a few
  years later and if hearing aids were not already highly successful for me.) We
  *already* merge with technology so much, and this is likely to increase in the
  future.




## Group 2: Technology, Excluding AI/Robotics

These are books loosely related to technology, though excluding AI and robotics,
as I discussed those in the previous section.

- \*\* **The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of
  Brilliant Technologies** \*\*, co-authored by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew
  McAfee. Both authors are from MIT: Brynjolfsson is a professor of management
  and McAfee a research scientist. The authors appear to take the opposite
  perspective of economist Robert Gordon (author of *The Rise and Fall of
  American Growth*, which I discuss later), a point that they emphasize
  repeatedly: they argue that we are now at an inflection point and that we are
  on our way towards *better* times, and not stagnation. Their key rebuttal to
  Gordon is that innovation is due to *recombination*. Sure, we may not invent
  *brand new* things like electricity, but the IT revolution was all about
  combining stuff that had previously existed, and that will continue onwards as
  more people are able to try new things. As expected, they provide the usual
  disclaimers (at least from the technologically elite) that technological
  growth isn't always great, that people fall behind, etc. To their credit, both
  men propose solutions, which I think are reasonable and --- crucially in
  today's politics --- are widely agreed upon by economists across the entire
  political spectrum.  For instance, they mention the universal basic income but
  seem to prefer the more mainstream "earned income tax credit" idea, and I
  think I can agree. One major quibble I have is that the book has one chapter
  to AI, but the actual AI portion of it is only *two and a half pages long*.
  And this for what might be the biggest technology advance of the 21st century!
  Fortunately, they seem to have given it greater attention since the book was
  first published. I bought *The Second Machine Age* in December 2016 as a
  Christmas gift, and they included a new introduction saying that they had
  underestimated progress in AI, particularly with deep neural networks, a topic
  which I frequently blog about here! (Incidentally, I saw Brynjofsson's praise
  for a MOOC on Deep Learning ... even MIT professors are going to MOOCs[^moocs]
  to learn about the subject!) The book is relatively straightforward to read
  and oozes more excitement compared to Gordon's book. There is a [book
  website][3] for more details if you are interested.  Brynjofsson and McAfee
  have since written more about Deep Learning, as you can see from [their NY
  Times article after AlphaGo famously beat Go super-duper star Lee Sodol][4]. I
  feel extremely fortunate to be in a position where, though I'm not the one
  *creating* this stuff, I can *understand* it.

- \*\* **How Google Works** \*\* is a 2014 book (updated in 2017) with a
  self-explanatory title, written by two of the most knowledgeable people about
  Google, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg. The former was the CEO of Google
  from 2001 to 2011 until he stepped down to be come "Executive Chairman" of
  Google (and then Alphabet later). So ... basically he's shuffling around
  titles without loss of power, I think.[^berkeley] Jonathan Rosenberg[^father]
  was a longtime Product Manager for Google, and now he is advisor to Alphabet
  CEO Larry Page. These two men thus know a *lot* about Google and are
  well-qualified to talk about it. The book is an entertaining mix of the
  lessons they've learned about working at Google, how to scale it up, etc. I
  was particularly impressed about stories such as how Jeff Dean et al. found a
  note from the CEO who complained that "these ads suck". So in *one weekend*,
  despite them *not being on the ads team*, they were able to fully diagnose the
  problem. Wow, that's Google for you. The main takeaway from this book is that
  I need to be a better *smart creative*. The only way I know how to do this is
  by always learning, whether by coding or (as I try to do) read a lot of books.
  That being said, the book does suffer from trying to describe many concepts
  that I would argue are obvious and well-known.  Many themes, such as "think
  10x better, not incremental" are common in books that combine technology and
  business, such as Peter Thiel's *Zero to One* book, which I read last year.
  Another is that "you can't apply the lessons you learn in business school"
  which is again something commonly assumed in the tech industry.  Another is
  "hiring is the most important thing you can do" but [Joel Spolsky has already
  said something similar earlier on his blog][28].  I don't mean to completely
  negate the benefits of this book; it seems to maintain *just* enough of the
  "uniqueness" balance to make it a worthwhile read. Homer alert: I wish the
  authors would write a follow-up book where they discuss Artificial
  Intelligence. After all, current Google CEO Sundar Pichai has made it a point
  to emphasize AI for Google. To be fair, they mention it as one of the "things
  that might happen in the next five years", so right now we're smack dab in the
  middle of that time period. I'll keep watch in case they publish a sequel
  later. On a final note, reading this book made me want to work at Google!

- \*\* **Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and
  Threatens Democracy** \*\* is a 2016 book by mathematician-turned-data
  scientist and author (and [MathBabe][32] founder) Cathy O'Neil who argues that
  the use of large datasets in industry and government contexts has, well,
  increased inequality in our society. She describes stories about how the use
  of big data to predict whether someone will commit a crime or default on a
  loan has a harmful feedback loop on the poor and minorities. (Blacks are the
  minority group emphasized the most in the book.) Why is there a feedback loop?
  Minorities are more likely to be around people who are committing crimes, and
  the "birds of a feather" mentality among big data algorithms is that they tend
  to relate people to those who bear similar qualities. Whereas in the past, for
  instance, a banker might not have relied on big data but on his instincts to
  grant or deny loans, which would hurt women and minorities, nowadays we mostly
  have data algorithms to determine that, but even so, algorithms have their own
  biases and values (indeed, this is an academic research topic, see the [BAIR
  Blog post on this][33] which also uses Google's "labeling blacks as gorillas"
  example of algorithms trained on wrong data).  O'Neil calls for increased
  transparency in these algorithms, which she calls Weapons of Math Destruction
  (WMDs), and for the people working on these algorithms to better understand
  the values that are inherent in the models. I enjoyed most of the short,
  fast-paced book and highly recommend it. It's also worth noting that O'Neil
  regularly writes columns about this subject area, which interested readers
  should check out.

- \*\* **Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist's Guide to Thriving in the Age of
  Accelerations** \*\* is Thomas L. Friedman's most recent book, published in
  late 2016 (though the manuscript was done before the outcome of the
  presidential election). For a long time, I've been following Friedman's Sunday
  weekly columns at *The New York Times*, which has served as a preview for
  what's to come in the book: Moore's Law, the refugee/migration crisis,
  unstable governments, droughts and climate change, and the polarization at the
  highest level of American politics. Friedman goes through these and discusses
  topics much like he did in *The World is Flat*, though I think he tempers his
  idiosyncratic writing style. He mentions at one point a handful of policy
  changes he'd like to do, and claims he's neither left nor right politically
  and that those labels are now outdated. For instance, he's very free trade
  (right) but also for single-payer health care (left). I was duly impressed
  from the book because it taught me much about how the world works today. It
  also made me appreciate that I'm in a position where I can take advantage of
  what the world has to offer. *Thank You for Being Late* also mentioned several
  technical topics that I'm passionate about. It was really nice to see a
  mainstream, "non-technophobe" talk about Moore's Law, GitHub[^github], and
  even TensorFlow/Deep Learning (!!); he explained these topics as well as he
  could given the non-technical nature of the targeted audience. I also
  appreciated the surgeon general's comment in the end that America's biggest
  killer "was not heart disease, but isolation" which is ironic given how we are
  more connected than ever before.  Ultimately, I want to be part of that
  acceleration and, of course, to ensure that the vast majority of Americans
  aren't left behind (including myself!).  The book, however, made me concerned
  about the future. I finished this just a few days before Trump was inaugurated
  so ... hopefully things will be OK. 

- **What to Do When Machines Do Everything: How to Get Ahead in a World of AI,
  Algorithms, Bots, and Big Data** is a recent 2017 book by three leaders from
  Cognizant, a firm which I didn't know about beforehand. This book takes the
  now-standard view (at least among many technology thinkers) that automation
  will be overall better for us, destroying some jobs but also creating new ones
  and clearing out old drudgery. One thing the authors note which I haven't
  heard before is that they subscribe to the "S-Curve": we're in a "stall" zone,
  but for the next two decades, we will experience dramatic economic growth with
  more equalizing effects as it relates to income distribution. I find this hard
  to believe, unfortunately. Another perspective the authors bring is that once
  old entrenched companies make more of a digital transition, that's when we'll
  *really* see GDP take off. Regarding the book style, it's short and written in
  a mini-textbook style.  The abbreviations in it were a bit corny but I enjoyed
  the examples, at least the ones they had. I surprisingly didn't seem to enjoy
  it as much as some other similar books, probably because some of their advice
  is really high level and generic, over-simplifying things. All in all, I think
  the book is mostly correct on a technical level but may not be my style.




## Group 3: Business and Economics

I badly need to better understand the world of business, particularly due to the
increasing business-related importance of Artificial Intelligence nowadays.

- **How the West Grew Rich: The Economic Transformation of the Industrial
  World**. This is an old 1986 book by the late economist and historian Nathan
  Rosenberg and co-author L.E. Birdzell Jr, an attorney and legal scholar, and I
  have several quick thoughts. The first was that this book was a real slog for
  me to read. It's not even close to being the longest book I've read[^half] but
  I had to struggle through it; I think the writing style of 1986 is different
  from the one I'm used to today, but I'm also partly to blame since I spaced
  out my reading over many evenings when I was tired. In any case, this book is
  about capitalism in some sense, though the authors complain that the term is
  misleading. Their main argument is that the *freedom* of business and
  enterprise from religious and political control was the key factor in
  explaining the rise of the West, and not other factors generally attributed,
  such as science or mass production.  Judging from the book, the prevailing
  wisdom at that time may have been mass production, but apparently not to them.
  It's a bit interesting to think about what conclusions they make which are
  still relevant today, like how it's so hard for Third World countries to catch
  up. I was also amused at seeing the Soviet Union mentioned so much, and I had
  to remind myself: 1986, 1986, 1986. (In a shout-out to the AI people reading
  this, that was the year when Rumelhardt, Willimans, and Hinton published their
  famous backpropgation paper with "readable math".) Ultimately, while this book
  has some good spots in it, I lost focus too much to really benefit from it,
  and I think *The Rise and Fall of American Growth* is a vastly superior
  alternative, unless you want to get a better understanding of European stuff
  (not just American) and also some discussion about the Middle Ages.

- **Shop Class As Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work**, is a 2009 book
  written by Matthew Crawford, who has one of the most unusual profiles among
  authors I read. Crawford is a mechanic and works at a bike shop, but he also
  holds an undergraduate degree in physics and a PhD in political philosophy
  from the University of Chicago. After his PhD, he worked at a "think tank"
  (where he had to basically repeat what the oil companies wanted to say about
  global warming) and at a firm where his job was to basically rewrite abstracts
  of research papers (what?!?). His true heart lies in building things, where he
  *gets value*. Crawford is concerned that today's white-collar emphasis of the
  world focuses too much on removing value from humans (whereas mechanics can
  just point and say "here's my result!"), and the white-collar blue-collar
  divide is making the mechanics earn less respect across society. I am indeed
  concerned that this is true, especially with today's political divide among
  the college-educated and non-college educated, and I wish that more people
  with solid academics, those who have "never failed" had a little more
  humility.  (*I* certainly feel like I've failed a lot and I'm pretty
  academically credentialed compared to a lot of others.) In a sense, I get the
  feeling that this book is like Jaron Lanier's "You Are Not a Gadget" --- those
  two men might see a lot of common ground over their critiques of modern life,
  though for different reasons. One takeaway from the book is that I'm happy to
  be where I am since I can try and perform deep work to produce results (code,
  papers, etc.) that people can look at, as I am doing more frequently [on my
  GitHub account][6]. Unsurprisingly, this [was the key point Cal Newport made
  from this book][5].  Lastly, I can't resist mentioning one of the most
  interesting parts of this book. In a footnote in the seventh chapter, he talks
  about AI in the context of lamenting how humans were often being reduced to
  simple straightforward rules. His footnote talks about computer science and
  says the one hope for AI in the future is with neural networks since they're
  not reduced to simple rules. Wow ... that was in 2009 (*before* Alex-Net,
  etc.).  Even your bike shop repairman knows about Deep Learning!

- \*\* **The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to
  Create Radically Successful Businesses** \*\* is a 2011 book by software
  entrepreneur Eric Ries, known for co-founding [IMVU][53] and then later for
  consulting various start-ups through his *Lean Startup* methodology.  In this
  book, Reis provides a guide for start-ups, which he defines as: "[...] a human
  institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of
  extreme uncertainty". Note the *lack* of any comment about *company size*, and
  also note the inclusion of *extreme uncertainty*. This means start-ups can
  include non-profits, large companies, and even governmental organizations, so
  long as there is initial uncertainty in their roadmap.  *The Lean Startup*
  argues that, in order for startups to thrive, they must follow a
  *Build-Measure-Learn* feedback loop. Furthermore, that loop must be their
  competitive advantage compared to slower, bulkier competition. By building
  Minimum Viable Products, Reis argues that appropriate metrics (*not* "vanity
  metrics" as he calls them) and customer feedback can be measured rapidly.
  Understanding these early results then guides the startup towards the next
  step, which may or may not involve the painful act of *pivoting* to change
  strategies. The book's advice appears sound and reasonable. While I certainly
  don't have much experience in this area to fully critique the book, Reis has
  famous tech titans such as Sheryl Sandberg and Andrew Ng to vouch for the
  book, so I think I can trust the advice. (I found out about this book from
  Andrew Ng's reading recommendations.) While reading the book, I imagined
  what I would do if I tried to create (or more realistically, join) a start-up.
  My PhD program isn't going to last forever ... but I suppose while I'm here, I
  should emphasize the Minimum Viable Product aspect with respect to research.

- \*\* **The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There are No
  Easy Answers** \*\* is a 2014 book by billionaire venture capitalist Ben
  Horowitz where he recounts his experience running Loudcloud and Opsware as
  CEO. The book starts out by first describing the CEO experience. Then,
  Horowitz remarks about the lessons he's learned and outlines recommendations
  and guides on what he thinks CEOs should be like. The book concludes with him
  explaining how he founded the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which
  he's still running today[^thanks] to help technical founders become groomed
  CEOs. The book is fast-paced and feels like a high-octance novel, because
  Horowitz's tenure at Loudcloud and Opsware was anything but smooth.  Horowitz
  argues that there are *peacetime* CEOs and *wartime* CEOs, of which he was
  definitely the latter as he estimates he only had "three days of peace" when
  running the company. Loudcloud and Opsware initially raised a lot of money,
  but then after the dot-com crash, they struggled *a lot* and I'm amazed that
  Horowitz turned it around and eventually sold the company for $1.6 billion to
  Hewlett-Packard.  Reading his story, and Elon Musk's story (which I'll get to
  later), makes me wonder how these two CEOs managed to pull their companies out
  from the financial brink. I am kind of surprised that something "comes out of
  nothing," and one of my disappointments is that it arguably spends a lot of
  time on Horowitz's lessons for the CEO whereas I would have preferred more
  details on his CEO experience (at least, more than what's in the book)
  because, again, I don't understand how companies can go to a billion dollars'
  worth of value out of nothing. I really need to step in the shoes of a CEO one
  of these days.  But perhaps I would have better understood this if I
  understood more about business, and I certainly learned *a lot* about the
  business word from reading this book.  For instance, I'm embarrassed to say
  that I only had a vague notion of what it meant for "a company to go public"
  but reading this book (and checking Wikipedia, Investopedia, and other online
  resources in parallel) made me better understand the process.

- \*\* **The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since
  the Civil War** \*\* is a *long* book by economist Robert Gordon, published in
  January 2016. For an academic-style book that's 762 pages long, it is quite
  well-known, particularly due to the current debates on economic growth in
  politics. On Google, you can find pages and pages of reviews for Gordon's
  book. Most of them mirror [Bill Gates' review][1] in that they praise Gordon
  for providing a surprisingly complete historical picture of what American life
  was like in 1870, and how it was completely transformed in the "great century"
  to 1970. Gone were the days of darkness, backbreaking labor, endless drudgery
  in chores, and a stale diet, among other things, and in place of those came
  the electric light bulb, work conditions in heated and air-conditioned
  offices, the internal combustion engine (leading to automobiles and the
  airplane), and shopping centers to buy a variety of food and clothes. Gordon's
  thesis is that since 1970, America has been in a long reign of slow growth
  despite the recent progress in AI, IT, and other tech-related fields. There
  are two reasons: these advances do not match up with those from previous
  generations (to echo Peter Thiel, "we wanted flying cars but ended up with 140
  characters [Twitter]"), and there are headwinds preventing rapid growth such
  as income inequality, college debt, and demographic trends. He ends with a
  brief postscript on policy actions that might be useful to counter these
  trends; I wish more politicians would take note of them as some of his
  suggestions have broad appeal nowadays. This book is amazing, and despite my
  close connection with the technology sector, I agree with his thesis. Bill
  Gates counters by suggesting we're on the cusp of medical advances, but I'm
  heavily skeptical about researchers finding cures for cancer and Alzheimer's
  disease. It might be challenging for the average reader to go through a book
  this long, especially one packed with figures and footnotes. My advice? Read
  it. It's worth it. I have probably learned more from this book than I have
  from any other.




## Group 4: Biographies and Memoirs

I am reading biographies of famous people because I want to be famous someday.
My aim is to be famous for a good reason, e.g., developing technology that
benefits large swaths of humanity. (It is obviously easier to become famous for
a *bad* reason than a good reason.)

- \*\* **Alan Turing: The Enigma** \*\* is the definitive biography of Alan
  Turing, quite possibly the best computer scientist of all time. The book was
  written in 1983 by Andrew Hodges, a British mathematics tutor at the
  University of Oxford (now retired). I discussed this [in a separate blog
  post][16] so I will not repeat the details here.

- \*\* **My Beloved World** \*\* is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's
  memoir, published in 2013. It's written from the first person perspective and
  outlines her life from starting in South Bronx and moving up to her
  appointment as a judge to US District Court, Southern District of New York. It
  --- unfortunately --- doesn't talk much about her experiences after that,
  getting appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
  in 1998, and of course, her time on the nation's highest court starting in
  August 2009. She had a father who struggled with alcoholism and died when she
  was nine years old, and didn't appear to be a good student until she was in
  fifth grade, when she started to obsess over getting "gold stars." (I can
  attest to a similar experience over obsessing to get "gold star-like" objects
  when I was younger.) She then, as we all know, did well in high school and
  entered Princeton as one of the first incoming batch of women students and
  Hispanic students, graduating with stellar academic credentials in 1976 and
  then going on to Yale Law School where she graduated in 1979. The book
  describes her experiences in vivid terms, and I liked following through her
  footsteps. I feel and share her pain at not knowing "secrets" that the rich
  and privileged students had when I was an undergrad (I was clueless about how
  finance and investment banking jobs worked, and I'm still clueless today.)
  Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It's brilliantly written, with an engrossing,
  powerful story. I will be reminded of her key attribute of *persistence* and
  *determination* and *focus* which she says were key. I'm trying to pursue the
  same skills myself.  While I understand the low likelihood of landing such
  tiny jobs (e.g., the tech equivalent of a Supreme Court Justice) I do try and
  think big and that's what motivates me a lot. I read this book on a day trip
  where I was sitting in a car passenger seat, and I sometimes dozed off and
  imagined myself naming various hypothetical Supreme Court Justices.

- **An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist** is Richard Dawkins'
  first of two (!!) autobiographies, published in 2013 and which accounts for
  the first half of his life. Dawkins is one of the most famous and accomplished
  scientists today, not only in terms of raw science but also with respect to
  public outreach and fame (whether famous, in my opinion, or infamous, if
  otherwise), so perhaps two books is justified. Dawkins discusses his
  childhood, which he first spent in Africa before moving to England to attend
  boarding schools; he remarked that the students seemed to be relatively
  stronger in Africa. I sometimes wish I had attended boarding schools instead
  of my standard public schools, since perhaps I would have developed
  independence faster, so it was interesting to read his perspective. After
  this, Dawkins talks about his undergraduate years at Oxford[^themaking] (where
  his relatives had gone) and this is where I really want to know what he did,
  because I'm hoping to use my own "appetite for wonder" in science, since I
  think Artificial Intelligence is the new electricity.  But anyway, Dawkins
  became a professor at Berkeley (!!) but he quickly left to return to England
  for another position.  This book ends with his publication of *The Selfish
  Gene*, a book that I want to read one of these days. I'm impressed: it's a
  challenge to write an autobiography, but fortunately, Dawkins' parents saved a
  lot of letters and information, so that's good. The book, however, is likely
  aimed at a niche audience of readers. It was also interesting to Dawkins used
  to be religious, before becoming an atheist by his late teens (like me, though
  I was never religious at all). I also liked his stories about computer
  programming and research, which were a lot simpler back then but presumably
  harder due to lack of documentation and the Internet.

- **Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science** is Richard Dawkins' *second*
  autobiography, written in 2015 and covering the second half of his life, at
  least, up to that point (he could theoretically still have 30 more years if he
  lives long enough). He writes more about his life as a professor at the
  University of Oxford, including his time as the inaugural Simonyi "Professor
  of the Public Understanding of Science," which I have to admit was an odd
  title when I first read it in the back flap of my copy of *The God Delusion*.
  He certainly has helped *me* understand things in this world, and it's true
  that I consider Richard Dawkins to be one my heroes. On the other hand, I'm
  not sure most lay readers would be willing to slog through both of his
  autobiographies, so keep this in mind in case you're on the fence about
  reading this book. It is a non-chronological history of his academic life
  about debates (uh oh), being on television, writing books, giving talks, and
  so forth.  Dawkins describes various stories about him with other famous
  people. I also learned a little more about basic evolution. His previous
  autobiography highlighted how *genes* --- and not the individual --- are the
  unit of evolution, but in his book *The Extended Phenotype*, he talks about an
  extension of natural selection onto the physical world (interesting, though
  one must not misinterpret this). He also emphasizes, and this is something I
  agree with, that natural selection can still explain complicated structures
  today that creationists use as evidence against evolution, such as the eye.
  Natural selection is the only theory we have of what can work *gradually and
  cumulatively*. This is key for developing complicated structures; in the
  absence of evidence, God should not be the default option. I also liked other
  tidbits of the book, such as how Dawkins did a lot of "evolutionary
  programming" --- I bet he would be interested in reading the research paper
  [Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement
  Learning][13].

- \*\* **Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future** \*\*
  is a 2015 biography of Elon Musk, written by technology journalist Ashlee
  Vance. He documents Musk's chaotic life, both nowadays as the CEO of SpaceX
  and Tesla and before, when he was struggling to get his companies off the
  ground and earlier still, when he started his entrepreneurial spirit by
  starting Zip2. Musk grew up in South Africa and moved to Canada so that he
  could get to the United States as quickly as possible. Musk had some initial
  businesses successes, but was forced out of X.com (which particularly hurt as
  Musk is the personality who wants full control over his companies), then
  earned some more success with Tesla and SpaceX before teetering on the brink
  of collapse at the end of 2008 (you know, like the financial "oopsie" we had).
  Then later, those companies recovered, Musk married a young actress, divorced,
  then re-married (then divorced again ...). The book concludes with some
  thoughts on Musk's wild personality and ambitions, and basically says that
  there is no one like Musk, who still is holding out hope for humans to go to
  Mars by 2025. This book is an absolute thrill to read. Vance brilliantly
  writes it so that the reader often feels like he or she is swept up into "Elon
  Musk"-mode: hard-working, super-charging, and borderline out of control. After
  reading it, I kept thinking that my work ethic is too soft and weak, and that
  I better get back to working sixteen hours a day (or less, if I've focused
  *really* hard in fewer hours). I have two main criticisms of this book. The
  first is that I was hoping to see more information from his two wives, and for
  this I'll probably have to relegate myself to reading Justine Musk's blog. The
  second and most important critique is that when Vance wrote an updated
  epilogue in January 2017, which was five months before I bought the book at
  Chicago O'Hare International Airport, he *never mentioned* Musk's investment
  in [OpenAI][17], a nonprofit AI research company which aims to produce, or
  pave the path to, artificial general intelligence. In their [introductory blog
  post][18] from December 2015, they claim to have 1 billion dollars in
  investment. I'm not sure how much Musk contributed to that, but it must have
  been a lot!

- **Keeper of the Olympic Flame: Lake Placid's Jack Shea vs. Avery Brundage and
  the Nazi Olympics**, a recent 2016 book by Michael Burgess, is one that
  hits home to me because Jack Shea was my great-uncle.  Jack Shea was born and
  raised in Lake Placid, New York, and as a 21-year-old competitor in the 1932
  Winter Olympics, he won two gold medals in speed-skating, becoming a hometown
  hero and putting Lake Placid "on the map." A few years later, when it became
  apparent that the next Winter Olympics were going to be in Nazi Germany, Shea
  urged Avery Brundage (then in charge of American involvement in the Olympics)
  to boycott out of concerns over Adolf Hitler's treatment of Jews and other
  minorities. Shea did not participate in those controversial Olympics, but the
  Americans did send a team, with relatively disappointing speed-skating
  results. The book then discusses more about the intersection between politics
  and sports, and also talks about the odd déjà vu when Lake Placid again hosted
  the Winter Olympics in 1980, *again* with politics causing tension (this time,
  from the Soviet Union).  For obvious reasons, I enjoyed reading this book
  despite its flaws: it's short and has obvious typos.  I like knowing more
  about my ancestors and what they did, and the photos were really striking. My
  favorites include 19-year-old Shea shaking hands with then-governor Franklin
  Roosevelt, another one with Shea and his extended family (including my
  grandfather), and a third which shows a pre-teen Shea and his brother, Eugene,
  already in skates. Eugene, incidentally, lived to be 105 years old
  (!!) before passing away in October this year ([obituary here][47]) and was
  able to contribute photos and assistance to the author.  I got to meet Jack
  Shea once, and he might very well have lived to be 100 years of age had he not
  been killed by a drunk driver at the age of 91. This was 17 days before his
  grandson would end up winning a gold medal in the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter
  Olympics. In my parent's home, there is a photo of me with my cousin holding
  his gold medal (it was heavy!). I also have a [separate blog post about this
  book soon after I read it][46].




## Group 5: Conservative Politics and Thoughts

Well, this will be interesting. I'm not a registered Republican, though I
possess a surprisingly large amount conservative beliefs, some of which I'm not
brave enough to blog about (for obvious reasons). In addition, I believe it is
important to understand people's beliefs across the political spectrum, though
for this purpose I exclude the extreme far left (e.g., hardcore Communists) and
right (e.g., the fascists and the Ku Klux Klan).

- \*\* **Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make it Harder for Blacks to
  Succeed** \*\* a 2014 book written by *Wall Street Journal* columnist Jason
  Riley. It's no secret that (a) most blacks tend to be liberal, I would guess
  due to the liberals getting the civil rights movement correct in the 1960s,
  and (b) blacks tend to have more credibility when criticizing blacks compared
  to whites. Riley, as a black conservative, can get away with roundly
  criticizing blacks in a way that I wouldn't do since I do not want to be
  perceived as a racist. In *Please Stop Helping Us*, Riley "eviscerates
  nonsense" as described by his hero, [Thomas Sowell][37], criticizing concepts
  such as the minimum wage, unions, young black culture, and affirmative action
  policies, among other things, for the decline in black prosperity. His chief
  claim is that liberals, while having *good intentions*, have not managed to
  achieve their desired results with respect to the black population.  He also
  laments that young blacks tend to watch too much TV, engage in hip-hop
  culture, and the like. One of his stories that stuck with me was when a young
  (black) relative asked him: "why are you so *white*", when all Riley did was
  speak proper English and tuck in his shirt. Indeed, variants of this story are
  common complaints that I've seen and heard about from black students and
  professionals across the political spectrum. I don't agree with Riley on
  everything. For instance, Riley tends to ignore or explain away issues
  regarding racism as it relates to the lack of opportunities for job promotions
  or advancement, or when blacks are penalized more relative to others for a
  given crime. On the other hand, we agree on affirmative action, which he
  roundly criticizes, pointing out that no one wants to be the token "diversity
  hire".  To his credit, he additionally mentions that Asians are hurt the most
  from affirmative action, as [I pointed out in an earlier blog post][38],
  making it a dubious policy when it come to advancing racial equality. In the
  end, this book is a thought-provoking piece about race. My impression is that
  Riley genuinely wants to see more blacks succeed in America (as I do), but he
  is disappointed that the major civil rights battles were all won decades ago,
  and nowadays current policies do not have the same positive impact factor.

- \*\* **The Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More
  Prosperous America** \*\*, is a 2015 book by Arthur Brooks, the president of
  the [American Enterprise Institute][7], officially a nonpartisan think tank
  but widely regarded (both inside and outside the organization) as a place for
  conservative public policy development and analysis. Brooks argues that
  today's conservatives, while they have most of the technical arguments right
  (e.g., on the benefits of free enterprise), lack the "moral high ground" that
  liberals have. Brooks cites statistics showing that conservatives are seen as
  less compassionate and less caring than liberals. He argues that conservatives
  can't be about being anti-everything: government, minimum wage increases, food
  stamps, etc. Instead, they have to show that they care about people. They need
  to emphasize *an equal starting line* for which people can flourish, which
  contrasts with the common liberal perspective of making the *end product*
  equal (by income redistribution or proportional racial representation). One
  key point Brooks emphasizes is the need for *work fulfillment* and *purpose*
  instead of lying around while collecting checks from the American welfare
  state. I liked this book and found it engaging and accessible. It is, Brooks
  says, a book for a wide range of people, including "open-minded liberals" who
  wish to understand the conservative perspective. I have two major issues with
  his book, though.  The first is that while he correctly points out the uneven
  recovery and the lack of progress on fixing poverty, he fails to mention the
  technological forces that have created these uneven conditions (see my
  technology, economics, and business related books above), much of which is
  outside the control of any presidential administration or Congress.  The
  second is that I think he's been proved wrong on a lot of things.  President
  Donald Trump is virtually *none* of the stuff that a conservative "heart"
  would suggest and, well, he was elected President (after this book was
  published, to boot). I wish President Trump would start following Brooks'
  suggestions.

- **Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a
  Return to Principle** is a brief 2017 book/manifesto by U.S. Senator Jeff
  Flake of Arizona. Flake is well known for being one of those "Never Trump"
  style of Republicans since he remains true to certain Republican principles
  that have arguably fallen out of favor with the recent populist surge of
  Trump-ian Republicanism in 2016, such as free trade and limited government
  spending. And yes, I don't think Republicans can claim to be the party of
  fiscal prudence nowadays, since Trump is decidedly *not* a limited spending
  conservative. In this book, Senator Flake argues that Republicans have to get
  back to true, Conservative principles and can't allow populism and immaturity
  to define their party. He laments at the lack of bipartisanship in Congress,
  and while he makes it clear that both parties are to blame, in this book he
  mostly aims at Republicans. This explains why so many Republicans, including
  Barry Goldwater's relatives, [dislike this book][39]. (Barry Goldwater wrote a
  book of the same title, "Conscience of a Conservative", from which Jeff Flake
  borrowed the title.) I *sort of* liked this book but didn't *really* like it.
  It still fails to address the notion of how the parties have fallen apart, and
  he (like everyone else) preaches bipartisanship without proposing clear
  solutions. Honestly, I think the main reason I read it was not that I think
  Flake has all the solutions, but that I sometimes think of myself in Congress
  in my fantasies. Thus, I jumped at the chance to read a book directly from a
  Congressman, and particularly a book like this where Flake bravely didn't have
  his staff revise it to make it more "politically palatable." It's a bit raw
  and lacks the polish of super-skilled writers, but we shouldn't hold Senators
  to such a high writing standard so it's fine with me.  It's unfortunate that
  Flake isn't going to seek re-election next year.


## Group 6: Self-Help and Personal Development

I'm reading these "personal development" books because, well, I want to be a far
more effective person than I am right now. "Effectiveness" can mean a lot of
things. I define it as being vastly more productive in (a) Artificial
Intelligence research and (b) my social life.

- \*\* **How to Win Friends and Influence People: The Only Book You Need to Lead
  You to Success** \*\* is Dale Carnegie's famous book based on his human
  interaction courses. It was originally published in *1936*, during the depths
  of the Great Depression, making this book *by far* the oldest one I've read
  this year. I will not go into too much depth about it since I wrote [a
  summary in an earlier blog post][24]. The good news is that 2017 has been a
  *much* better year for me socially, and the book might have helped. I look
  forward to continuing the upward trend in 2018, and [to read other Dale
  Carnegie books][36].

- \*\* **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal
  Change** \*\*, written by Stephen R. Covey in 1989, is widely considered to be
  the "successor" to Dale Carnegie's classic book (see above summary). In *The 7
  Habits*, Covey argues that the habits are based on *well-timed principles* and
  thus do not noticeably vary across different religious groups, ethnic groups,
  and so forth. They are: "Be Proactive", "Begin With the End in Mind", "Put
  First Things First", "Think Win-Win", "Seek First to Understand, Then to be
  Understood", "Synergize", and "Sharpen the Saw". You can find their [details
  on the Wikipedia page][25] so I won't repeat the points here, but I will say
  that the one which really touches upon me is "Think Win-Win". In general, I am
  *always* trying to make more friends, and I'd like these to be win-win. My
  strategy, which aligns with Covey's (great minds think alike!), is to start a
  relationship by *doing more work than the other person* or *letting the other
  person benefit more*.  Specifically, this means that I will be happy to (a)
  take the initiative in setting meeting times and any necessary reservations,
  (b) drive or travel farther distances, (c) let the other person choose the
  activity, and so forth.  At some point, however, *the relationship needs to be
  reciprocal*. Indeed, I often tell people, subtly or not so subtly, that the
  true test of friendship is if friends are willing to do things for you just as
  much as you do to them.  With respect to the six other principles, there isn't
  much to disagree. There is striking similarity to [Cal Newport's Deep
  Work][26] when Covey discusses high-impact, Quadrant II activities.  Possibly
  my main disagreement with the book is that Covey argues how these principles
  come (to some extent) from religion and God. As an atheist, I do not buy this
  rationale, but I still agree with *the principles themselves* and I am trying
  to follow them as much as I can. This book has earned a place on my desk along
  with Dale Carnegie's classic, and I will always remember it because I want to
  be a highly effective person.

- **You are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an
  Awesome Life** is a 2013 book by self-help guru Jen Sincero. It's deliberately
  written in a very "teenage"-like way, where the author acts like she's talking
  directly to the reader as the self-help coach. The target audience seems to be
  people who have "screwed up" and feel like their life is not as awesome as it
  could be. She goes through 27 relatively short chapters, each with different
  generic advice, though she does repeat this each chapter: *love yourself*. I
  definitely need reminders about that, since *I* don't feel like I am achieving
  enough in life. However, I was somewhat skeptical of her advice and in general
  I am a self-help skeptic since I think it's better for me to build my
  technical skills than to try and optimize advice from self-help books.
  Overall, I did not enjoy this book (largely due to the writing style), and I'm
  surprised it's gotten so much critical acclaim and that it's a best-seller.
  Yes, I will "love myself" but I can't see myself remembering many other
  tidbits about this book that I didn't already know before (e.g., *think
  positive!!*). Perhaps this book would be better suited with some concrete
  success stories of Sincero's clients.



## Group 7: Psychology and Human Relationships

These books are about psychology, broadly speaking, which I suppose can include
"human relationships". I thoroughly enjoyed reading all four of these books.

- \*\* **Thinking, Fast and Slow** \*\* is a famous 2011 book by Daniel
  Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision
  making. This is a book about psychology and how humans think, and much of it
  is based on Kahneman's research with Amos Tversky many decades ago. To make
  the concepts clearer to the reader, Kahneman describes a story consisting of
  *System 1* and *System 2*. These are the fast and slow parts of our thinking,
  respectively, so the former represents our immediate intuition and the latter
  reflects what happens after we expend nontrivial amounts of effort on some
  task. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* is filled with informative anecdotes,
  thrilling insights, and unexpected contradictions about the way humans think,
  and supplements those with exercises to the reader. (I normally find these
  annoying, but here they were reasonable.) Possibly the biggest insight I
  gained is that human thinking is flawed and is easily manipulated, so I better
  be extra cautious if I have to make important judgments in my life. (For minor
  life decisions, I don't have a hope of remembering all the advice in this 400+
  page book.) To be clear, I already knew that humans behaved irrationally, but
  Kahneman does an excellent job in putting my haphazard thoughts about human
  irrationality on more solid footing.  Kahneman augments that with related
  topics such as overconfidence (a major issue with CEOs and start-ups) and how
  anchoring, priming, and baselines influence human preferences. After reading
  the book, all I can say is, I think (pun intended!) *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
  lives up to its billing as a true classic.

- \*\* **To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others** \*\* is a
  2012 book by best-selling author [Daniel Pink][44]. He argues that we should
  stop focusing on outdated views of salespeople. That is, that they are slimy,
  conniving, attempting to rip of us off, etc. Today, one in nine work in
  "sales" but Pink's chief message to the reader is that *the other eight of
  nine are also in sales*. We try to influence people all the time. So in some
  sense this is obvious. I mean, come on, if I'm aiming to get a girlfriend,
  then I'm trying to influence her based on my positive qualities.[^forthesake]
  For academics, we sell our work (i.e., research) all the time. That's what
  Pink means when he says "everyone is working in sales." He argues that
  nowadays, the barriers have fallen (he *almost* says "The World is Flat" [a la
  Thomas L. Friedman][43]) and that salespeople are no longer people who walk
  door by door to ask people to buy things. That's outdated. One possible
  negative aspect of the book is that I don't think we need this much "proof"
  that we're all salespeople.  Yes, some people think only in terms of that job,
  but all you have to do is say: "hey everyone is a salesperson, if you try to
  become friends with someone, that counts..." and if you tell that to people,
  all of a sudden they'll get it and I don't think belaboring the point is
  necessary. On the positive side, the book contains several case studies and
  lists of things to do, so that I can think of these and reread the book in
  case I want to apply them in my life.  Indeed, as I was reading this book, I
  was also thinking of ways I could convince someone to become friends with me.

- \*\* **Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead** \*\* is a well-known 2013
  book by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. It's a semi-memoir which also acts as a
  manifesto for women (and men) to be more aware of the gender gap in
  "prestigious positions" and how to counteract it. By such "prestigious
  positions" I mean CEOs (particularly of top companies), politicians, and other
  leadership positions.  Women occupy fewer of these positions than men in
  virtually every country in the world, and Sandberg wants this to change. She
  outlines numerous factors that hold women back, not all of which are obvious.
  Her first example deals with parking spots reserved for pregnant women, in
  which she admits she (despite being a woman!) didn't think about until she
  became pregnant herself. Pregnancy is a major focus in this book, along with
  work-life balance, a typical inclusion in books about women and careers.
  Sandberg also recounts stories about women being quiet in meetings or not
  taking seats in the center of a meeting table even when prompted to do so, and
  lowering their hands when people say there are no more questions (despite how
  men keep their hands up and thus get to ask more questions).  This forms the
  overall basis for her advice that women must "lean in" and be more involved in
  discussions. I liked reading this fast-paced book but I also almost felt
  disappointed, since I anticipated much of the material in advance.  Perhaps
  it's because I read about gender-related issues frequently. Another possible
  explanation is that it is hard for me to participate in group meetings, so I
  often spend more time *observing* people and noticing things rather than
  focusing on the subject at hand.  On a final note, I'd like to mention that I
  do, in some sense, believe that "other men are the problem, not me" though I
  would never say this in public to someone, because (a) it's politically
  charged, and (b) I could, of course, make a mistake in the future and thus I
  would be hypocritical and have to eat my own words. In my adult life, I do not
  believe I have ever done anything *blatantly* sexist, though I certainly worry
  a lot about committing "microaggressions" when I interact with women, and do
  my best to avoid them to make my female (as well as male) conversationalists
  feel respected and comfortable.

- \*\* **Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World** \*\* is a recent 2016
  book by famous Wharton professor [Adam Grant][21], also known as the author of
  *Give and Take*. I've been aware of Grant for some time, in part because he's
  been featured in Cal Newport's writing as someone who engages in the virtues
  of *Deep Work* ([see an excerpt here][22]). Yeah, he's *really* productive,
  finishing a PhD in less than three years[^thoughsome] and then becoming the
  youngest tenured professor at his university. But what is *this* book about,
  anyway? In *Originals*, Grant argues that people who "buck the trend" are
  often ones who can make a difference for the better. As I anticipated ahead of
  time, Martin Luther King Jr is in the book, but not for all the reasons I
  thought. One of them --- why procrastination might actually have been helpful
  (i.e., first mover disadvantage) for him when he was crafting his "I Have a
  Dream" speech, though one was more realistic: focusing on the victims of
  crimes (blacks facing discrimination) rather than criticizing the
  perpetrators. Another nice tidbit from Grant was making sure to emphasize the
  *downsides* of your work rather than the positives to venture capitalists, as
  that will help you look more sincere. Other stuff in this book include how to
  foster a correct sense of dissent in a company (e.g., Bridgewater Associates
  is unique in this regard because people freely criticize the billionaire
  founder Ray Dalio). I certainly felt like some of this was cherry-picking,
  which admittedly is unavoidable, but this book seems to pursue that more than
  others. Nonetheless, a lot of the advice seems reasonable and I hope to apply
  it in my life.




## Group 8: Miscellaneous

These books, in my opinion, don't neatly align in one of the earlier groups.

- \*\* **Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking
  Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World** \*\* is Harvard physics
  professor Lisa Randall's second of three major books. [Last year, I read her
  most recent book][34] *Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs*, so this is "going back"
  in time back to 2011. Sorry, I know should have read them in order. But
  anyway, this book is a fascinating exploration of what I argue are two major
  topics. First, the [Large Hadron Collider][40] --- the well-known experimental
  setup that revealed the Higgs Boson particle in 2012 and earned Peter Higgs an
  Nobel Prize. Randall describes how the experiment was set up in great detail,
  but with *juuuuuust* enough clarity for non-physicists like me to barely
  follow. I don't have much knowledge about the LHC, and indeed I didn't even
  know it was a fantastic engineering feat; it is an enormous system built deep
  underground in Europe, as the pictures in the book helped to illuminate.  The
  second major part of the book is about scientific thinking itself: why do
  scientists revise theories, why is the notion of *scale* important, why is
  quantum mechanics important at smaller distances, but why can we "average out"
  its effects with Newtonian physics? I learned a little about how the Standard
  Model in physics works, and it was great to see how she describes the
  scientific approach to thinking.  Randall also discusses cosmology in this
  book, but it's much shorter relative to particle physics and feels slightly
  out of place, but fortunately any reader who wants an overview in cosmology
  should just read *Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs.* Overall, this is a book that
  somehow remains fascinating and mostly accessible despite all the physics
  facts and jargon.  It's tricky to write science books for the general public.
  Randall does a good job in that when I was reading the book and felt somewhat
  confused at the jargon, I felt like it was *my* fault for my incompetence, and
  not hers. I am now thinking about reading her first book, *Warped Passages*,
  or her e-book on the Higgs Discovery. I'll definitely be on the lookout for
  any future books she publishes!

- \*\* **The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail -- But Some
  Don't** \*\* is Nate Silver's 2012 book where he urges us to consider various
  issues that might be adversely affecting the quality of predictions. They
  range from the obvious, such as political biases which affect our assessment
  of political pundits (known as "hedgehogs" in his book), and perhaps less
  obvious things such as a bug in the Deep Blue chess program which nonetheless
  grandmaster Gary Kasparov took to meaning that Deep Blue could "predict twenty
  moves into advance." I really enjoyed this book. The examples are far ranging:
  how to detect terrorist attacks (a major difficulty but one with enormous
  political importance) to playing poker (Silver's previous main source of
  income), to uncertainties involving global warming models (always important to
  consider), and to the stock market (this one is hardest for me to understand
  given my lack of background knowledge on the stock market, but I am learning
  and working to rectify this!).  The one issue I have is that Silver seems to
  just assume: hey let's apply Bayes' rule to fix everything, so that we have a
  prior of $$X$$, and we *assume* the probability of $$Y$$ ... and therein lies
  the problem. In real settings we rarely get those $$X$$ and $$Y$$ values to a
  high degree of accuracy.  But I have no issue with the general *idea* of
  revising predictions and using Bayes' rule. I encourage you to see a [related
  critique in *The New Yorker*][23]. The reality, by the way, is that most
  current professional statisticians likely employ a mix of Frequentist and
  Bayesian statistics. For a more technical overview, check out Professor
  Michael I. Jordan's talk on [*Are You A Bayesian or a Frequentist?*][41].

- \*\* **The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of
  Consciousness** \*\* is a splendid 2015 book by author Sy Montgomery, who has
  written numerous biology-related books about animals. I would call this
  entirely a popular science book; it's more like a combination of the author
  discovering octopuses and describing her own experience visiting the New
  England aquarium, learning how to scuba dive, watching octopuses having sex in
  Seattle, and of course, connecting with octopuses. To be frank, I had no idea
  octopuses could do any of the things she mentions in the book (such as walking
  on dry land and squeezing through a tiny hole to get out of a tank). Clearly,
  aquariums have their hands full trying to deal with octopuses. Much of the
  book is about trying to connect with the three octopuses the New England
  aquarium has; the author regularly touches and feeds the octopuses, observing
  and attempting to understand them. I was impressed by the way Montgomery
  manages to make the book educational, riveting, and emotional all at once,
  which was surprising to me when I found out about the book's title. It's
  surely a nice story, and that's what I care about.

- **Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War** is a book by USC English
  Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen, published in 2016 and a finalist for [the
  National Book Award in Non-Fiction][27] that same year. It's not a recap or
  history of the Vietnam War (since that subject has been beaten to death) but
  instead it focuses specifically on how people from different sides (obviously,
  American and Vietnamese, but also the rest of the world) view the war, because
  that will shape questions such as who is at fault and should make reparations
  and also how we can *avoid* similar wars in the future. It's an academic-style
  book, so the writing is a bit dry and it's important not to read this when
  tired. I think it provides a useful perspective on the Vietnam War and
  memories in general. Nguyen travels to many areas in Vietnam and Asia and
  explores how they view America --- for instance, he argues that South Korea
  attempts to both ally with the US and look down on Vietnam with contempt. I
  found the most thought-provoking discussion to be about identity politics and
  how minorities often have to be the ones describing their own experiences.
  I've observed this in the books I read, in which if they're written by a
  minority author (and here I'll include Asians despite how critics of the tech
  industry bizarrely decide otherwise) are often about said minority. Other
  interesting (though obvious) insights include how the entire war machine and
  capitalism of the US means it can spread its memories of the war more
  effectively than Vietnam can. Thus, the favorable American perspective of the
  US as attempting to "save" minorities is more widespread, which puts America
  in a better light than (in my opinion, channeling my inner Noam Chomsky) it
  deserves.

- **The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics** is a short book
  (describing it as an essay is probably more accurate) written by humanities
  professor Mark Lilla of Columbia University. This book grew out of his
  fantastic (perhaps my all-time favorite) [Op-Ed in the NYTimes][42] about the
  need to end identity politics, or specifically *identity liberalism*. I agree
  wholeheartedly; we need to stop treating different groups of people as
  monolithic. Now, it is certainly the case that racism or mistreating of any
  group must be called out, and *white* identity politics is often played on the
  right, versus the variety of identities on the left. Anyway, this short book
  is split into three parts: anti-politics, pseudo-politics, and politics, but
  this doesn't seem to have registered much to me, and the book is arranged in a
  different style as I might have hoped. I was mostly intrigued by how he said
  Roosevelt-esque liberalism dominated from roughly 1930 to 1970. Then the
  Reagan-esque conservatism (i.e., the era of the *individual*) has dominated
  from 1980 to 2016 or so, and now we're supposed to be starting a new era as
  Trump has demolished the old conservatism. But Lilla is frustrated that modern
  liberalism is so obsessed about identity, and quite frankly, so am I. He is
  correct, and many liberals would agree, that change must be aimed locally now,
  as Republicans have dominated state and local governments, particularly
  throughout the Obama years. I do wish, however, that he had focused more
  directly on (a) how groups are not monolithic, (b) why identity politics is
  bad politics. I know there was *some* focus, but there didn't seem to be
  enough for me. But I suppose, this being a short essay, he wanted to
  prioritize the Roosevelt-Reagan parallels, which in all fairness is indeed
  interesting to ponder.

- \*\* **Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens can Save the
  Planet** \*\*, a 2017 book jointly written by Michael Bloomberg and Carl Pope.
  Surprisingly, considering that I was born and raised in New York state all my
  life (albeit, upstate and not in the city) the first time I really learned
  about Bloomberg was when he gave the commencement speech at my college
  graduation. [You can view the video here][15], and in fact, to the right you
  can barely see the hands of a sign language interpreter who I really should
  re-connect with sometime soon. *Climate of Hope* consists of a series of
  chapters, which are split into half from Bloomberg's perspective, half from
  Pope's perspective. The dynamics between the two men are interesting. Pope is
  a "typical" Sierra Nevada member, while Bloomberg is known for being a
  ridiculously-rich billionaire and a three-term (!!) mayor of New York
  City.[^buymyway] The book is about cities, businesses, and citizens, and the
  omission of national governments is no accident: both men have been critical
  of Washington's failure to get things done. Bloomberg and Pope aim their ire
  at the "climate change deniers" in Washington, though they do levy slight
  criticism on Democrats for failing to support nuclear power. They offer a
  brief scientific background on climate change, and then argue that new market
  forces and the rise of cities (thus greener due to more public transportation
  and more cramped living quarters) means we should be able to emphasize more
  renewable energy. One key thing I especially agree with is that to market
  policies that promote renewable energy --- particularly to skeptical
  conservatives --- people cannot talk about how "worldwide temperatures in 2100
  will be two degrees higher." Rather, we need to talk about *things we can do
  now*, such as saving money, protecting our cities, creating construction jobs,
  protecting our health from smog, all these thing we can do *right now* and
  which will have the effect of fighting long-term climate change anyway. I
  enjoyed this easy-to-read and optimistic book, though it's also fair to say
  that I tend to view Bloomberg quite favorably and honor his commitment to
  getting things done rather than having dysfunction in Washington. Or maybe I
  just want to obtain a fraction of his professional success in my life.


<hr>

[^buymyway]: Given the fact that Bloomberg was able to buy his way into being a
    politician, I really think the easiest way for me to enter national politics
    is to have enormous success in the business and technology sector. Then I
    can just *buy* my way in, or use my connections. It's unfortunate that
    American politics is like this, but at least it's better than having a king
    and royal family.

[^github]: This blog is hosted on GitHub and built using software called Jekyll.
    [Click here to see the source code][2].

[^russell]: You'll also notice in that link that Stuart Russell says he thinks
    superintelligence will happen in "more than 25 years" but he thinks it
    *will* happen. Russell's been one of the leading academics voicing concern
    about AI. I'm not sure what has been *created* out of it, except raising a
    *discussion* of AI's risks, kind of like how Barrat's book doesn't really
    propose solutions. (Disclaimer: I have not read all of Russell's work on
    this, and I might need to [see this page for information][11].)

[^half]: To compare, *How the West Grew Rich* is less than half the length of
    *The Rise and Fall of American Growth*. In addition, I skipped most
    footnotes for the former, but read all the footnotes for the later.

[^accused]: In [this interview][52], Oren Etzioni said that AI leaders were not
    concerned about superintelligence, and even quoted an anonymous AAAI Fellow
    who said that Nick Bostrom was "the Donald Trump of AI". Stuart Russell, who
    has praised *Superintelligence*, wrote a rebuttal to Etzioni, who then
    apologized to Bostrom.

[^berkeley]: Eric Schmidt got his computer science PhD from Berkeley in 1982. So
    at least I know *someone* famous essentially started off on a similar career
    trajectory as I am.

[^father]: I didn't realize this until the authors put it in a footnote, but
    Jonathan Rosenberg's father is Nathan Rosenberg, who wrote the 1986 book
    *How the West Grew Rich* which I also read this year. Heh, the more I read
    the more I realize that it's a small world among the academic and
    technically elite among our society.

[^academic]: Most of the academic papers that I read can be found in [this GitHub
    repository][35].

[^forthesake]: For the sake of keeping this blog *mostly* professional, I won't
    list all my positive qualities here. ;)

[^thoughsome]: Usually, someone completing a PhD in 2-3 years raises red flags
    since they likely didn't get much research done and may have wanted to
    graduate ASAP. Grant is an exception, and it's worth noting that there are
    also [exceptions in computer science][45].

[^themaking]: Dawkins mentions that, if anything was "the making" of him, Oxford
    was. For me, I consider Berkeley to be "the making of me" as I've learned
    much more, both academically and otherwise, here than at Williams College.

[^thanks]: A quick thanks to Ben and Marc for helping to fund Berkeley's
    Computer Science Graduate Student Association!

[^moocs]: Of course, this raises the other problem with MOOCs. Only people who
    have sufficient motivation to learn are actually taking advantage of MOOCs,
    and these tend to be skewed towards those who are already well-educated.
    Under no circumstances is Brynjolfsson someone who *needs* a MOOC for his
    career. But there are many people who cannot afford college and the like,
    but who don't have the motivation (or time!) to learn on their own. Is it
    fair for them to suffer under this new economy?
