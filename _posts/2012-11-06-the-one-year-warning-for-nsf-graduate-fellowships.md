After talking with someone who was toiling away at his physics National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship application, I checked the NSF [website][1]Â and saw that November 13 is the deadline for 2013 GRFP applications in computer science. As it&#8217;s the beginning of November, I&#8217;m aware that I probably have more important things to worry about than an application deadline that won&#8217;t affect me for at least another year. (Hey, I heard the Presidential election results will be out in a few days&#8230;.)

But in the back of my mind, I know it&#8217;s almost certain that I will be applying for a computer science NSF Graduate Fellowship next fall. I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;ll handle that along with four courses (one of which will be a thesis), graduate school applications, and likely some teaching assistant duties, but I&#8217;ll manage.

One thing that caught my eye from the NSF website was this text:

> The NSF welcomes applications from all qualified students and strongly encourages under-represented populations, including women, under-represented racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, to apply for this fellowship.

So does that mean that a deaf person, like me, has a slight advantage in receiving a fellowship, as compared to similarly qualified students? It sounds like it, which can only be good news for me. I&#8217;m not sure how many deaf computer science Ph.D students have received NSF Fellowships. (A quick search online gave me no results.) I&#8217;m obviously hoping to be one of the few to get this ultra-competitive fellowship. I am curious, though, as to how much of my application should focus on being deaf. Should it be the main topic of my application essays? Should I make it one of many points as to why I would be a nice candidate for a fellowship? My college application essays focused almost entirely about my being deaf; given my lackluster acceptance results, perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t talk about being deaf that much? But then again, the application fellowship has *several* required essays encompassing a variety of topics; I should probably avoid talking about deafness on, for instance, the previous research essay, since my previous research hasn&#8217;t had anything to do with being deaf.

Obviously, this is just pure speculation as I ponder about the NSF Graduate Fellowship program. The next few years for me have the potential to give me an enormous head-start on my future career. I&#8217;m crossing my fingers that everything will proceed as planned. But for now, I thought I&#8217;d post this up here to remind myself of an important date to keep in mind for the next year.
