A [few days ago][1], I said that I was on the hunt for simple, yet effective deaf-friendly strategies that most people would be able to apply in life.

Here&#8217;s a basic one.

> As much as you can, articulate as if you&#8217;re in an interview.

To be more specific, suppose you&#8217;re on the job market with a freshly minted Ph.D. In today&#8217;s situation, you may be competing with 300 other qualified candidates for one tenure-track faculty position at your dream school. If you manage to get an interview, you should feel proud, but it&#8217;s not a job guarantee. A competent interview means you remain in the applicant pool, and a terrible one &#8230; well, you get the idea.

So during that interview, what are the odds that you&#8217;ll mumble, slur or fail to fully project your voice as your interviewer stands across you? If you&#8217;re serious about getting the job, I think you&#8217;ll articulate very clearly.

> But do most people extend this kind of voice in informal conversations?

I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the case. Certainly for me, I pay much more attention to my speech when I&#8217;m giving a lecture or talking to a prominent person. But I need to work on *extending that mentality to all conversations*. I want to always make a good impression on my conversationalist by speaking as well as I can. If everyone else tried to do the same thing, we would all benefit.

That&#8217;s why getting into a habit like this is useful.

So please, as much as possible, do the following:

  * Project your voice and articulate by moving your lips. This is similar to not mumbling.
  * Focus on pronouncing the ends of your phrases to avoid sound tailing off.
  * Don&#8217;t talk in a rushed manner; relax and know that, for the most part, everything will be okay.
  * Don&#8217;t talk abnormally loud so that hearing people would wonder if there&#8217;s something wrong.

In my case, the first point I listed is the most helpful for me when I hear. But for those who may lack more &#8220;raw&#8221; hearing even with the help of assisted listening devices, the fourth *may* be more effective. But the first one, in my opinion, should take priority.
