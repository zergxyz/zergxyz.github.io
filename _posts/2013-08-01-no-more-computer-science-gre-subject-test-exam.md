A [while back][1], I said I was planning on taking the computer science subject exam for graduate
school. I knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be too much of a big deal for my application, but it would
at least give me an extra data point.

Of course, I didn&#8217;t realize that I was actually behind the times. The computer science GRE
subject test is no longer offered; the last time it was administered was in April 2013. The
following rationale is from the [Educational Testing Service (ETS) website][2].

> Over the last several years, the number of individuals taking the Computer Science Test has
> declined significantly. Test volume reached a point where ETS could no longer support the test
> psychometrically. As a result, the GRE Program discontinued the Computer Science Test after the
> April 2013 test administration. Scores will continue to be reportable for five years.

All I can say is that I&#8217;m relieved, since the test wouldn&#8217;t have helped me that much and
it saves me the studying time. Furthermore, these subject tests tend to be more helpful for those
applications who either (1) don&#8217;t come from a top school, or more importantly, (2)
didn&#8217;t major in computer science.Â Since that doesn&#8217;t describe my scenario, I
didn&#8217;t need to depend on the subject test at all.

There are others who are perfectly fine with seeing the test discontinued. Such viewpoints are
present in, for instance, [this blog post][3].

Of course, I&#8217;m just as guilty of bias as anyone else. Someone who didn&#8217;t major in
computer science will probably disagree with me. Also, I&#8217;ve heard that foreign students made
up much of the high scores on the exam, so this may hurt them a little. (But my knowledge here is
sketchy.)

Regardless, though, all this really means is that we can get back to our research.
