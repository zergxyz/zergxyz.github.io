The two mainstream newspapers that I read the most, *The New York Times* and
*The Wall Street Journal*, both have recent articles about diversity and the
tech industry, a topic which by now has considerable and well-deserved
attention. 

The [New York Times article][1] starts out with:

> Like other Silicon Valley giants, Facebook has faced criticism over whether
> its work force and board are too white and too male. Last year, the social
> media behemoth started a new push on diversity in hiring and retention.

> Now, it is extending its efforts into another corner: the outside lawyers who
> represent the company in legal matters.

> Facebook is requiring that women and ethnic minorities account for at least 33
> percent of law firm teams working on its matters.

The [Wall Street Journal article][2] says:

> The tech industry has been under fire for years over the large percentage of
> white and Asian male employees and executives. Tech firms have started
> initiatives to try to combat the trend, but few have shown much progress.

> The industry is now under scrutiny from the Labor Department for the issue.
> The department sued software giant Oracle Corp. earlier this year for
> allegedly paying white male workers more than other employees. Oracle said at
> the time of the suit that the complaint was politically motivated, based on
> false allegations, and without merit.

These articles discuss important issues that need to be addressed in the tech
industry. However, I would also like to gently bring up some other points that I
think should be considered in tandem.

- The first is to clearly identify Asians (and multiracials[^blog]) as either
  belonging to a minority group or not. To its credit, the Wall Street Journal
  article states this when including Asians among the "large percentage of
  employees", but I often see this fact elided in favor of just "white males."
  This is a broader issue which also arises when debating about affirmative
  action. Out of curiosity, I opened up the Supreme Court's opinions on *Fisher
  v. University of Texas at Austin* ([PDF link][5]) and did a search for the
  word "Asians", which appears 66 times. Only four of those instances appear in
  the majority opinion written by Justice Kennedy supporting race-conscious
  admission; the other 62 occurrences of "Asians" are in in Justice Alito's
  dissent.

- The second is to suggest that there are people who have good reason to believe
  that they would substantially contribute to workplace diversity, or who have
  had to overcome considerable life challenges (which I argue also increases
  work diversity), but who might otherwise not be considered a minority. For
  instance, suppose a recent refugee from Syria with some computer programming
  background applied to work at Google. If I were managing a hiring committee
  and I knew of the applicant's background information, I would be inspired and
  would hold him to a slightly lower standard as other applicants, even if he
  happened to be white and male. There are other possibilities, and one could
  argue that poor whites or people who are disabled should qualify.

- The third is to identify that there is a related problem in the tech industry
  about the pool of qualified employees *to begin with*. If the qualified
  applicants to tech jobs follow a certain distribution of the overall
  population, then the most likely outcome is that the people who get hired
  mirror that distribution. Thus, I would encourage emphasis on rephrasing the
  argument as follows: "tech companies have been under scrutiny for having a
  workforce which consists of too many white and Asian males *with respect to
  the population distribution of qualified applicants*" (emphasis mine). The
  words "qualified applicants" might be loaded, though. Tech companies often
  filter students based on school because that is an easy and accurate way to
  identify the top students, and in some schools ([such as the one I attend, for
  instance][3]), the proportion of under-represented minorities as traditionally
  defined has remained stagnant for decades.

I don't want to sound insensitive to the need to make the tech workforce more
diverse. Indeed, that's the *opposite* of what I feel, and I *think* (though I
can't say for sure) that I would be more sensitive to the needs of
under-represented minorities given my frequent experience of feeling like an
outcast among my classmates and colleagues.[^offense] I just hope that my
alternative perspective is compatible with increasing diversity and can work
alongside --- rather than against --- the prevailing view.

[^offense]: I also take offense at the stereotype of the computer scientist as a
    "shy, nerdy, antisocial male" and hope that it gets eradicated. I invite the
    people espousing this stereotype to live in my shoes for a day.
