The number of research papers in Artificial Intelligence has reached
un-manageable proportions. Conferences such as ICML, NIPS, and ICLR others are
getting record amounts of paper submissions. In addition, tens of AI-related
papers get uploaded to arXiv *every weekday*. With all these papers, it can be
easy to feel lost and overwhelmed.

Like many researchers, I think I do not read enough research papers. This year,
I resolved to change that, so I started an [open-source GitHub repository called
"Paper Notes"][1] where I list papers that I've read along with my personal
notes and summaries, if any. Papers without such notes are currently on my TODO
radar.

After almost three months, I'm somewhat pleased with my reading progress. There
are a healthy number of papers (plus notes) listed, arranged by subject matter
and then further arranged by year. Not enough for me, but certainly not terrible
either.

I was inspired to make this by seeing [Denny Britz's similar repository][2],
along with [Adrian Colyer's blog][3]. My repository is similar to Britz's,
though my aim is not to list all papers in Deep Learning, but to write down the
ones that I actually plan to read at some point. (I see other repositories where
people simply list Deep Learning papers without notes, which seems pretty
pointless to me.) Colyer's blog posts represent the kind of notes that I'd like
to take for each paper, but I know that I can't dedicate *that* much time to
fine-tuning notes.

Why did I choose GitHub as the backend for my paper management, rather than
something like [Mendeley][4]? First, GitHub is the default place where (pretty
much) everyone in AI puts their open-source stuff: blogs, code, you name it. I'm
already used to GitHub, so Mendeley would have to provide some serious benefit
for me to switch over.  I also don't need to use advanced annotation and
organizing materials, given that the top papers are easily searchable online
(including their BibTeX references).  In addition, by making my Paper Notes
repository online, I can show this as evidence to others that I'm reading
papers. Maybe this will even impress a few folks, and I say this only because
everyone wants to be noticed in some way; that's partly Colyer's inspiration for
his blog.  So I think, on balance, it will be useful for me to keep updating
this repository.
